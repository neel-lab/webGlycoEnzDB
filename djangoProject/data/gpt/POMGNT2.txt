### Function
Human POMGNT2, or protein O-linked mannose N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2, is an enzyme involved in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a protein crucial for muscle integrity and proper brain function. POMGNT2 specifically adds N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues on O-linked glycans, similar to POMGNT1, but targets different steps or aspects of the glycosylation process. This modification is vital for the functional interaction of alpha-dystroglycan with components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin.

### Reaction Pathways
POMGNT2 functions within the O-mannosyl glycosylation pathway, where it catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to a mannose residue on the growing glycan chains of alpha-dystroglycan. This reaction is essential for building the glycan structures that allow alpha-dystroglycan to properly bind to extracellular matrix proteins. The activity of POMGNT2 is crucial for the formation of fully functional glycoproteins that maintain the structural stability of muscle cells and play roles in neural development.

### Location
POMGNT2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the central hub for protein modification and sorting within the cell. The Golgi provides the necessary environment for POMGNT2 to interact with its target proteins and perform the glycosylation modifications essential for their function. This localization ensures that alpha-dystroglycan and other glycoproteins are properly processed before being transported to the cell membrane or other cellular locations.

### Diseases
Mutations in the POMGNT2 gene are associated with a spectrum of congenital muscular dystrophies, including severe conditions like Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) and muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB). These disorders are characterized by profound muscle weakness, brain malformations, and eye abnormalities. The diseases result from defective glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, leading to impaired cell-matrix interactions and compromised tissue integrity. Understanding the role of POMGNT2 in glycosylation is critical for diagnosing these disorders and exploring potential therapeutic approaches.
