Write a 100-350 word essay about human POGLUT2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human POGLUT2 (Protein O-Glucosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins through the addition of O-glucose to serine or threonine residues. This specific form of glycosylation is essential for the proper functioning and regulation of certain proteins, particularly those with epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) repeats.

POGLUT2 is primarily involved in the O-glucosylation of proteins containing EGF-like repeats. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the folding, stability, and function of these proteins. EGF-like repeats are found in several key proteins, including those involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is vital for cell differentiation, development, and tissue homeostasis.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), POGLUT2 facilitates the addition of glucose molecules to target proteins. This modification can influence protein-protein interactions, cellular signaling pathways, and the overall behavior of cells.

Dysfunction or mutations in the POGLUT2 gene can lead to abnormalities in protein glycosylation, potentially resulting in various developmental and physiological disorders. While specific diseases directly linked to POGLUT2 mutations are not well-documented, the enzymeâ€™s role in modifying proteins crucial for development suggests its potential involvement in developmental disorders or diseases related to impaired cell signaling.

For more information on POGLUT2 and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
