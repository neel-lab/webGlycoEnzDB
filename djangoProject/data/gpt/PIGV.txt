### Function
Human PIGV, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class V, is an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that attach specific proteins to the cell membrane, where they play crucial roles in cell signaling, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGV is specifically responsible for adding the second mannose residue to the GPI precursor, a critical step in the assembly and maturation of the GPI anchor.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGV operates within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Following the initial addition of the first mannose by PIGM, PIGV catalyzes the transfer of the second mannose from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) to the growing GPI anchor. This step is essential for the proper formation of a functional GPI anchor, which will undergo further modifications before being attached to proteins destined for the cell membrane.

### Location
PIGV is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of protein synthesis and early post-translational modifications. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGV to perform its role in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, ensuring that the GPI anchors are correctly assembled. The proper localization of PIGV in the ER is crucial for the accurate processing and function of GPI-anchored proteins.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGV gene are associated with hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), also known as Mabry syndrome. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, intellectual disability, seizures, and various skeletal and facial abnormalities. The condition arises due to defective GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to the improper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins. Understanding PIGVâ€™s role in this process is essential for diagnosing and developing treatments for conditions like HPMRS, where GPI anchor deficiencies lead to significant clinical challenges.
