Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGV: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGV (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class V) is an integral enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are complex glycolipids that tether specific proteins to the cell surface. PIGV plays a pivotal role in this process by participating in the addition of the second mannose to the GPI anchor precursor, a crucial step in GPI biosynthesis.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGV is part of the intricate pathway that constructs GPI anchors. The proper assembly of GPI anchors is essential for the correct localization and functioning of a wide range of proteins on the cell surface, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules. These GPI-anchored proteins are involved in various biological functions, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

Mutations in the PIGV gene can lead to a rare congenital disorder known as Mabry syndrome, or Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation syndrome (HPMRS). This condition is characterized by elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, intellectual disability, seizures, and distinctive facial features. The link between PIGV mutations and Mabry syndrome highlights the critical role of GPI-anchored proteins in neurological development and function.

For more detailed information on PIGV and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:

These references provide insights into the biochemical properties of PIGV, its significance in GPI-anchor biosynthesis, and the implications of its dysfunction in Mabry syndrome, a GPI anchor-related congenital disorder.
