### Function

Human CHSY3 (Chondroitin Sulfate Synthase 3) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix. CHSY3 exhibits dual glycosyltransferase activities, functioning as both a glucuronyltransferase and an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. This dual functionality enables CHSY3 to catalyze the polymerization of chondroitin sulfate chains, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of connective tissues, cartilage, and skin.pdf】.

### Reaction Pathways

CHSY3 operates within the chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine to the growing polysaccharide chain in the Golgi apparatus. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the elongation of chondroitin sulfate chains. The interactions of CHSY3 with other enzymes, such as CHSY1 and CHPF, are essential for efficient chain elongation and modification, ensuring the production of biologically active chondroitin sulfate. This sulfation and elongation process is critical for the proper formation of glycosaminoglycans, which play vital roles in cellular signaling and structural integrity.pdf】.

### Location

CHSY3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, functioning as a type II transmembrane protein. Its catalytic domain faces the lumen of the Golgi, where it can access its substrates and catalyze the polymerization of chondroitin sulfate chains effectively. This localization is essential for the enzyme's role in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, ensuring that these molecules are properly synthesized and functional before being transported to their final destinations in the extracellular matrix.

### Diseases

Mutations or dysregulation of CHSY3 are associated with several pathological conditions, including skeletal abnormalities and developmental disorders. While specific human diseases directly linked to CHSY3 mutations are still being studied, its role in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate suggests that defects in CHSY3 can lead to impaired extracellular matrix formation, affecting tissue integrity and function. Altered expression of CHSY3 has also been observed in certain cancers, where changes in glycosaminoglycan synthesis can influence tumor growth and metastasis by modifying the extracellular matrix and cell signaling pathways.pdf】.

In summary, CHSY3 is a critical enzyme for the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, contributing to the structural integrity and functionality of the extracellular matrix. Its proper function and regulation are essential for normal cellular processes, and its dysregulation can lead to significant pathological conditions.
