### Function

Human C1GALT1 (Core 1 beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 1), also known as T-synthase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in O-glycosylation. It catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) on Serine or Threonine residues, forming the core 1 structure (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), also known as the T-antigen. This core structure serves as a precursor for various complex O-glycans, which are essential for numerous biological functions including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune response.

### Reaction Pathways

C1GALT1 operates in the O-glycosylation pathway, a process critical for the biosynthesis of mucin-type O-glycans. The enzyme's activity is dependent on a specific molecular chaperone known as COSMC (C1GALT1C1), which ensures proper folding and activity of C1GALT1 in the Golgi apparatus. In the absence of COSMC, C1GALT1 is inactive, leading to the accumulation of the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), which can result in various pathological conditions. The proper function of C1GALT1 is essential for the synthesis of core 1 and core 2 O-glycans, which are vital for the structural integrity and function of glycoproteins.

### Location

C1GALT1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it acts as a type II transmembrane protein. The enzyme's active site is oriented towards the lumen of the Golgi, allowing it to access its substrates, UDP-galactose and GalNAc-Ser/Thr. This localization is critical for its role in the sequential glycosylation steps that occur during the maturation of glycoproteins. The expression of C1GALT1 is ubiquitous, indicating its fundamental role in cellular glycosylation processes across different tissues.

### Diseases

Mutations or defects in C1GALT1 or its chaperone COSMC are associated with several diseases. One notable condition is Tn syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease caused by somatic mutations in the COSMC gene, leading to defective C1GALT1 activity and the accumulation of Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens. This results in various hematological abnormalities. Additionally, mutations in C1GALT1 can cause congenital disorders such as IgA nephropathy and thrombocytopenia, characterized by improper glycosylation of IgA and platelet glycoproteins, respectively. These defects highlight the importance of C1GALT1 in maintaining normal glycosylation patterns and cellular functions【32:3†Glycobiology】.

In summary, C1GALT1 is a pivotal enzyme in O-glycosylation, essential for the formation of core 1 structures on glycoproteins. Its function and proper regulation are critical for normal cellular processes and the prevention of various diseases associated with glycosylation defects.
