Write a 100-350 word essay about human PLOD1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PLOD1 (Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase 1) is a critical enzyme in collagen biosynthesis, predominantly involved in the post-translational modification of collagen, a major structural protein in the human body. PLOD1 specifically catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen, a process essential for the formation of stable collagen cross-links and, consequently, the strength and integrity of connective tissues.

PLOD1 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells, where it facilitates the hydroxylation of lysine residues in procollagen chains. This hydroxylation is vital for the subsequent glycosylation of these hydroxylysine residues and the formation of mature collagen fibrils. Collagen fibrils are fundamental components of various tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, and tendons, providing structural support and resilience.

Mutations in the PLOD1 gene can lead to a rare connective tissue disorder known as Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (kEDS). kEDS is characterized by hypermobile joints, skin hyperextensibility, and a high propensity for scoliosis and kyphosis (spinal curvature abnormalities). Patients with kEDS often have fragile skin, a tendency for bruising, and may experience cardiovascular complications related to connective tissue weakness. The disorder highlights the crucial role of PLOD1 in maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues.

For more detailed information on PLOD1 and its association with connective tissue disorders, the following key references are recommended:
