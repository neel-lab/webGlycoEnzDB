Write a 100-350 word essay about human HS3ST2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human HS3ST2 (heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 2) is an enzyme playing a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a type of glycosaminoglycan extensively involved in cell signaling and interaction processes. HS3ST2 specifically catalyzes the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues in HS chains, a modification that imparts unique functional properties to HS, influencing its interactions with various proteins such as growth factors, chemokines, and morphogens.

Located primarily in the Golgi apparatus, HS3ST2 modifies HS chains attached to core proteins, thereby creating heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). These HSPGs are critical components of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces, with roles in developmental processes, wound healing, and vascular biology. The sulfation pattern introduced by HS3ST2 is particularly important in determining the specificity and affinity of HS-protein interactions.

The 3-O-sulfation conducted by HS3ST2 is not as widespread as other sulfation processes in HS biosynthesis, but it is crucial for certain biological activities. For instance, the interaction of HS with antithrombin, a key regulator of blood coagulation, is dependent on this specific sulfation.

Dysfunction in HS3ST2 has been linked to various pathophysiological conditions. While the direct association with specific diseases is less clear compared to other sulfotransferases, aberrant expression or activity of HS3ST2 could potentially contribute to disorders involving aberrant cell signaling and extracellular matrix organization, such as cancer and fibrotic diseases.
