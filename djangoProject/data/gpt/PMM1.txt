Write a 100-350 word essay about human PMM1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human PMM1 (Phosphomannomutase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. PMM1 is involved in the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, a key step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose. GDP-mannose is an essential substrate for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, a process crucial for their proper function and cellular localization.

PMM1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the aforementioned reaction in the mannose pathway. This pathway is integral to the synthesis of N-glycans, which are attached to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. N-glycosylation is essential for protein folding, stability, and trafficking.

Deficiencies or dysfunctions in PMM1 can lead to disorders in glycosylation. One such condition is Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), specifically PMM1-CDG (formerly known as CDG-Ia). CDG encompasses a group of rare inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in the glycosylation of proteins. PMM1-CDG can present with various symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), and multisystemic involvement.

For more detailed information on PMM1, the following key references are recommended:
