Write a 100-350 word essay about human NDST2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human NDST2 (N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a type of glycosaminoglycan essential for various biological functions. Similar to its family member NDST1, NDST2 catalyzes two key reactions in HS biosynthesis: the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues and the sulfation of the resulting glucosamine residues. These modifications are crucial for creating the unique structural domains within HS chains, which are vital for their interactions with a wide array of proteins.

NDST2 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it modulates the sulfation pattern of HS, influencing its binding affinity and specificity for various ligands. This enzymatic activity of NDST2 is essential for the diverse roles of HS in cell signaling, morphogenesis, blood coagulation, and inflammation.

Although NDST2's specific implications in human diseases are not as extensively studied as NDST1, aberrations in HS biosynthesis, to which NDST2 contributes, can be associated with a range of pathological conditions. Altered HS structure and function due to NDST2 dysfunction could potentially play a role in developmental disorders, tumor progression, and metastasis. NDST2's involvement in HS biosynthesis also suggests its potential significance in congenital disorders of glycosylation and other metabolic disorders linked to glycosaminoglycan metabolism.

For more detailed information on NDST2 and its role in HS biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
