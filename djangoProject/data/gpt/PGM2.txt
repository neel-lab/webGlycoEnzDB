Write a 100-350 word essay about human PGM2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human PGM2 (Phosphoglucomutase 2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). This reversible reaction is crucial for the proper utilization of glucose within the cell, affecting processes like glycogen synthesis and glucose mobilization.

Located in the cytoplasm, PGM2 is involved in managing cellular energy resources. In the glycogen synthesis pathway (glycogenesis), it facilitates the conversion of G6P (derived from glucose or gluconeogenesis) to G1P, which is then used for glycogen synthesis. Conversely, during glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen), PGM2 helps convert G1P, released from glycogen, back to G6P, which can enter glycolysis for energy production or be directed towards other metabolic pathways.

While the specific diseases directly linked to PGM2 dysfunction are not as well-documented as those associated with PGM1, any abnormalities in PGM2 could potentially disrupt normal glucose and glycogen metabolism. This could lead to issues with energy production and storage, affecting various tissues, particularly those reliant on glycogen, such as muscle and liver.

For more detailed information on PGM2 and its role in metabolism, the following key references are recommended:
