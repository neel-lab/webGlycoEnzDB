### Function
Human MGAT5, or N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of complex N-glycans. MGAT5 catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the alpha-1,6-linked mannose residue of the core N-glycan structure. This enzymatic activity results in the formation of tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans, which are crucial for protein stability, cell signaling, and immune function. MGAT5’s activity is essential for the branching of N-glycans, which influences the biological activity and half-life of glycoproteins.

### Reaction Pathways
MGAT5 operates within the N-glycosylation pathway, a vital post-translational modification process. After the initial steps of glycan trimming and modification in the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi, MGAT5 acts in the medial-Golgi to add a GlcNAc residue to the alpha-1,6-linked mannose. This step is critical for generating highly branched N-glycans, which play essential roles in cell-cell communication, receptor-mediated signaling, and protein stability. The activity of MGAT5 is pivotal in creating complex glycan structures that determine how glycoproteins interact with other cellular components.

### Location
MGAT5 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, specifically in the medial-Golgi compartment, where it performs its role in N-glycan processing. The Golgi apparatus is a central organelle for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids before they are transported to their final destinations. MGAT5’s strategic location within the Golgi allows it to access and modify glycoproteins at a crucial stage in their maturation, ensuring that they acquire the necessary glycan branches for proper function.

### Diseases
Alterations in MGAT5 activity have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and autoimmune disorders. Overexpression of MGAT5 is often observed in various cancers, where it contributes to increased N-glycan branching on cell surface receptors, enhancing tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion. Additionally, abnormal MGAT5 activity has been linked to autoimmune diseases, where changes in glycosylation patterns can affect immune cell function and lead to inappropriate immune responses. Understanding MGAT5’s role in these diseases is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies that target glycosylation abnormalities to treat cancer and autoimmune conditions.
