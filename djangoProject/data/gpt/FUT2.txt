Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human FUT2. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function

Human FUT2 (fucosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the H antigen, a precursor for the ABO blood group antigens, in secretory tissues. FUT2 transfers fucose from GDP-fucose to the terminal galactose of oligosaccharides in an Î±1,2 linkage. This activity is critical for producing soluble H antigens in bodily secretions like saliva, mucus, and milk. The presence of these antigens in secretions determines an individual's secretor status, which plays a significant role in host-pathogen interactions and influences susceptibility to various infections.

### Reaction Pathways

FUT2 operates within the fucosylation pathway, where it specifically catalyzes the addition of fucose to Type 1 and Type 3 oligosaccharides. This reaction produces the H antigen, which can be further modified by other glycosyltransferases to generate A or B antigens in the ABO blood group system. The activity of FUT2 in secretory tissues ensures that these antigens are present in body fluids, playing a role in immune response and microbial adhesion.

### Location

FUT2 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells of secretory tissues, including the salivary glands, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory and reproductive tracts. The enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it carries out its fucosylation activity. This Golgi localization is essential for the proper modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids before they are secreted or transported to the cell surface.

### Diseases

Mutations in the FUT2 gene can lead to a condition known as non-secretor status, where individuals do not express the H antigen in their secretions. Non-secretors are more susceptible to certain infections, such as Norovirus and Helicobacter pylori, but may have protection against others. For example, non-secretors are less likely to get Norovirus infections. Additionally, non-secretor status has been associated with a higher risk of developing certain conditions, such as Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders.

In summary, FUT2 is a crucial enzyme in the fucosylation pathway, responsible for producing the H antigen in secretory tissues. Its activity is linked to various health conditions and plays a significant role in determining an individual's susceptibility to infections and other diseases.
