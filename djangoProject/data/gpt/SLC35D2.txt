Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35D2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human SLC35D2, also known as the UDP-galactose transporter 2, is a crucial component in the complex process of glycosylation. This transporter is part of the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family and plays a pivotal role in the transport of nucleotide sugars, specifically UDP-galactose, into the Golgi apparatus where it is used for glycosylation reactions.

Located in the Golgi membrane, SLC35D2 is responsible for transporting UDP-galactose from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen. Once inside the Golgi, UDP-galactose serves as a substrate for galactosyltransferases, which add galactose moieties to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This step is critical for the proper formation and function of these glycoconjugates, which are essential for various cellular functions, including cell signaling, protein stability, and immune responses.

Dysfunction or mutations in the SLC35D2 gene can potentially lead to abnormalities in glycosylation, impacting the structure and function of glycoproteins and glycolipids. While specific diseases directly attributed to SLC35D2 mutations are not well-documented, disruptions in glycosylation pathways are known to contribute to a range of disorders. These include congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in the glycosylation process, leading to diverse clinical manifestations depending on the type and severity of the glycosylation defect.

For more detailed information on SLC35D2, its function, and role in glycosylation, the following key references are recommended:
