Write a 100-350 word essay about human MGAT4B : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human MGAT4B (Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 4B) is an enzyme that plays a key role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, essential for the maturation and modification of glycoproteins. Functionally similar to its paralog MGAT4A, MGAT4B adds N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues on the oligosaccharide chains of nascent glycoproteins, a critical step in synthesizing complex and hybrid N-glycans.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MGAT4B's enzymatic action contributes to the proper folding, stability, and functioning of glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein trafficking. The specific addition of GlcNAc by MGAT4B is important for the structural diversity of glycoproteins and their recognition and interaction with other cellular components.

While there are no specific diseases directly linked to mutations in the MGAT4B gene, disruptions in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, in which MGAT4B is involved, can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of rare metabolic disorders with a broad spectrum of symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and immune system dysfunctions. These conditions underscore the importance of glycosylation in human health and development.
