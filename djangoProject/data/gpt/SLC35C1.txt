Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35C1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35C1, known as the GDP-fucose transporter, is an essential component in the glycosylation pathway, specifically involved in the transport of GDP-fucose from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. SLC35C1 is a member of the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family and plays a crucial role in fucosylation, a type of glycosylation that adds fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Located in the Golgi membrane, SLC35C1 facilitates the availability of GDP-fucose for fucosyltransferases, which catalyze the transfer of fucose to growing glycan chains in the synthesis of glycoconjugates. Fucosylation is important for various biological processes, including cell signaling, immune response, and the development of selectins and blood group antigens.

Mutations in the SLC35C1 gene can lead to a rare genetic disorder known as Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type IIc (CDG-IIc), also referred to as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (LAD-II). CDG-IIc/LAD-II is characterized by growth retardation, intellectual disability, and a distinctive type of adhesion defect in leukocytes. This adhesion defect is due to the lack of fucosylated structures, which are crucial for leukocyte rolling and migration, leading to recurrent infections and immune dysfunction.

For more detailed information on SLC35C1 and its association with CDG-IIc/LAD-II, the following key references are recommended:

These references provide insights into the biochemical role of SLC35C1, its significance in the fucosylation process, and the implications of its dysfunction in conditions such as Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type IIc and Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II.
