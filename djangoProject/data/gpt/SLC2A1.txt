Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC2A1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human SLC2A1, also known as GLUT1 (Glucose Transporter Type 1), is an integral membrane protein that functions as a facilitative glucose transporter. SLC2A1 is crucial for the transport of glucose across the plasma membranes of mammalian cells, utilizing the concentration gradient of glucose to move it from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration without the expenditure of energy (passive transport).

SLC2A1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with particularly high levels in erythrocytes (red blood cells) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the BBB, SLC2A1 is essential for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into the brain, providing the primary energy source for the central nervous system. This process is critical because, under normal physiological conditions, the brain relies heavily on glucose as its primary energy substrate.

Mutations or dysfunction in the SLC2A1 gene can lead to several diseases, most notably GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome (GLUT1-DS). GLUT1-DS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of neurological issues, including developmental delay, seizures, movement disorders, and a complex spectrum of cognitive impairments. The condition arises from insufficient glucose transport into the brain, leading to energy deficiency and associated neurological symptoms.

For more detailed information on SLC2A1 and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
