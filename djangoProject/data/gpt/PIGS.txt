Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGS: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGS (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class S) is a pivotal enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are essential glycolipids that link various proteins to the cell membrane, playing critical roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune responses.

PIGS is involved in one of the final steps of GPI anchor synthesis, where it facilitates the transfer of ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose in the GPI structure. This modification is crucial for the complete assembly and functionality of GPI anchors, enabling them to attach proteins to the cell surface efficiently.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGS operates within a complex enzymatic pathway that constructs GPI anchors. The proper synthesis and attachment of GPI anchors are vital for the correct localization and functioning of a variety of cell surface proteins, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules.

Deficiencies or mutations in enzymes involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis, including PIGS, can lead to GPI anchor deficiencies. These deficiencies can affect the proper expression and function of GPI-anchored proteins, leading to various health issues. While specific diseases directly linked to PIGS mutations are not extensively documented, general impairments in GPI anchor biosynthesis are known to cause a group of rare genetic disorders called GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). Patients with GPIBDs may present symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays, reflecting the importance of GPI anchors in neurological development and function.

For more detailed information on PIGS and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
