Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human HAS3. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human HAS3, or hyaluronan synthase 3, is an enzyme responsible for the production of hyaluronan, a key component of the extracellular matrix. HAS3 synthesizes hyaluronan by adding alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid. Unlike HAS1 and HAS2, HAS3 primarily produces lower molecular weight hyaluronan, which plays a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and inflammation.

### Reaction Pathways
HAS3 operates within the hyaluronan biosynthesis pathway, using UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as substrates to generate hyaluronan. This polysaccharide is then extruded into the extracellular matrix, where it influences various cellular behaviors. HAS3 is particularly active in producing lower molecular weight hyaluronan, which can interact with cell surface receptors like CD44 and RHAMM, triggering signaling pathways involved in cell motility, wound healing, and immune responses.

### Location
HAS3 is a transmembrane enzyme localized at the plasma membrane. Its active site is oriented towards the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the polymerization of hyaluronan. As the enzyme synthesizes hyaluronan, the growing polymer is simultaneously extruded into the extracellular matrix. This strategic location allows HAS3 to contribute directly to the extracellular environment, where hyaluronan plays critical roles in maintaining tissue structure and facilitating cellular interactions.

### Diseases
Dysregulation of HAS3 is linked to several diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. Overexpression of HAS3 can lead to the excessive production of low molecular weight hyaluronan, which is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis in cancers such as breast and colorectal cancer. In inflammatory diseases, increased HAS3 activity contributes to the accumulation of hyaluronan, exacerbating conditions like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis by promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling. Understanding HAS3's role in these diseases is crucial for developing therapies that target hyaluronan production and its effects on disease progression.
