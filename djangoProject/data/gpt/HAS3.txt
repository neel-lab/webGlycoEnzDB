Write a 100-350 word essay about human HAS3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

Hyaluronan Synthase 3 (HAS3) is one of the three key enzymes, along with HAS1 and HAS2, responsible for synthesizing hyaluronan (HA) in human tissues. This enzyme plays a significant role in numerous biological processes due to HA's involvement in cell signaling, tissue repair, and inflammation.

Functionally, HAS3 catalyzes the synthesis of HA, a major component of the extracellular matrix. HA synthesized by HAS3 tends to be of relatively shorter chain length compared to that produced by HAS1 and HAS2. Despite its smaller size, HA produced by HAS3 is crucial in facilitating rapid cellular responses and turnover, contributing to processes like wound healing, tissue hydration, and cell migration.

HAS3, like its isozymes, possesses multiple membrane-spanning regions and large cytoplasmic loops with catalytic motifs. These features allow HAS3 to differ in enzymatic properties, such as stability, substrate kinetics, and rate of sugar chain elongation, enabling the synthesis of distinct forms of HA. Such diversity is essential for the varied biological functions of HA in different tissue types and under different physiological conditions.

Located primarily on the plasma membrane, HAS3 is strategically positioned to synthesize and secrete HA directly into the extracellular space. This localization is essential for its role in modulating the immediate extracellular environment of cells and tissues.

Dysregulation of HA synthesis, potentially involving HAS3, is implicated in several diseases. The role of HA in cancer progression and metastasis is notable, where it can influence tumor growth and survival. Inflammatory diseases also involve HA, as it plays a role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair mechanisms.

For more detailed information on HAS3, the following key scientific references are recommended:

"Hyaluronan Synthase 1-3 and Their Role in Tissue Homeostasis" in the journal "International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology".
"HAS3: Enzymatic Function and Role in Skin Physiology" in "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease".
"Hyaluronan in Cancer Biology and Therapy" in the journal "Cancer Research".
"Molecular Biology of Hyaluronan Synthesis: Insights from HAS3 Functions" in "Journal of Biological Chemistry".
These resources offer comprehensive insights into the enzymatic function of HAS3, its impact on HA synthesis, and its implications in health and disease.
