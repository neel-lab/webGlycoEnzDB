Human CSGALNACT1, also known as Chondroitin Sulfate N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS), a critical component of the extracellular matrix in various tissues. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues in CS chains during both the initiation and elongation phases of CS biosynthesis​​.

CSGALNACT1, exhibiting approximately 60% identity and 89% similarity to its isoform CSGALNACT2, is characterized as a typical type-II membrane protein. It has a short cytoplasmic tail, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a large catalytic domain containing a DXD motif for divalent cation binding and a GWGGED motif common among glycosyltransferases of the b4GT family. Each of these enzymes contains two potential N-glycosylation sites​​.

The functional significance of CSGALNACT1 is underscored in studies using knockout mice. Mice deficient in Csgalnact1 exhibit abnormal cartilage development, characterized by shorter growth plates, abnormal chondrocyte layer organization, and a reduction in aggrecan, the most abundant cartilage chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). This reduction in aggrecan indicates that CSGALNACT1 is crucial for normal endochondral ossification and the synthesis of CS chains in the epiphyseal cartilages. The absence of CSGALNACT1 causes a rapid catabolism of aggrecan, leading to a dwarf phenotype in the knockout mice​​​​.

In humans, mutations in the CSGALNACT1 gene have been linked to neurological diseases. Specifically, missense mutations in exons 5 and 10 of the CSGALNACT1 gene have been associated with neuropathies such as Bell’s palsy and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy​​.
