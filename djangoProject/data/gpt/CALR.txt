Human CALR (Calreticulin) is a multifunctional protein that plays significant roles in various cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis, protein folding, and immune response. Its diverse functions highlight its importance in cellular physiology and its involvement in several diseases.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CALR is primarily known for its role in calcium storage and regulation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It binds calcium ions, helping to maintain calcium balance in the cell, which is crucial for various cellular activities. Besides calcium regulation, CALR is involved in the proper folding of glycoproteins in the ER. It acts as a molecular chaperone, ensuring that proteins are correctly folded and assembled before they are transported to their destination. This chaperoning function is critical in maintaining protein quality control within the cell.

Location:
CALR is located in the ER, where it participates in protein folding and calcium homeostasis. Its presence in the ER is strategic for its roles in regulating calcium levels and assisting in the folding of newly synthesized proteins.

Diseases:
Mutations or dysfunctions in CALR are linked to several diseases. CALR mutations have been identified in certain myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. These mutations are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of these blood cancers. In addition, CALR's role in immune response links it to autoimmunity. The protein can act as an autoantigen in certain autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Furthermore, as a chaperone involved in protein folding, abnormalities in CALR function can contribute to diseases related to protein misfolding.

Key References:
For more information on CALR, consider the following key references:
