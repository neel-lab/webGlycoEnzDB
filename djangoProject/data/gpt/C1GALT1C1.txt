Human C1GALT1C1, also known as Cosmc, is a chaperone protein crucial for the proper functioning of C1GALT1, an enzyme involved in O-glycosylation. This protein's role is pivotal in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans, affecting various cellular processes and potential disease pathways.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
C1GALT1C1 acts as a molecular chaperone for C1GALT1 (Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase), ensuring its correct folding and stability. C1GALT1 is responsible for adding galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues on serine or threonine in mucin-type O-glycans. This reaction forms the core 1 structure (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr) and is crucial for the synthesis and extension of mucin-type O-glycans on various glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are involved in numerous biological functions, including cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. The presence of C1GALT1C1 is essential for the activity of C1GALT1, thereby influencing the overall process of O-glycosylation.

Location:
C1GALT1C1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it interacts with and stabilizes C1GALT1. The ER is critical for protein folding and maturation, and the role of C1GALT1C1 in this organelle is essential for ensuring the proper function of the glycosylation enzyme C1GALT1.

Diseases:
Mutations or malfunctions in C1GALT1C1 can lead to defects in O-glycosylation, as they compromise C1GALT1 function. Such defects are implicated in Tn syndrome, a disorder characterized by the presence of truncated O-glycans, which can lead to various immunological issues and potentially increase cancer risk. Additionally, altered O-glycosylation patterns have been linked to various cancers, suggesting a potential role of C1GALT1C1 in tumor progression and metastasis.
