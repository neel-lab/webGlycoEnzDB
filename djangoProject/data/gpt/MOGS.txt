Write a 100-350 word essay about human MOGS: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human MOGS (Mannosyl-Oligosaccharide Glucosidase), also known as glucosidase I, is an essential enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a critical process for the maturation and functioning of glycoproteins. MOGS specifically catalyzes the first step in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides on nascent glycoproteins by cleaving the terminal glucose residues. This action is vital for the proper folding and quality control of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

MOGS is located in the ER, where it plays a crucial role in the early stages of glycoprotein maturation. Its enzymatic activity ensures that glycoproteins are correctly folded and configured before they proceed through the secretory pathway. The proper functioning of MOGS is essential for the stability and activity of a wide array of glycoproteins involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, and protein trafficking.

Dysfunction in MOGS leads to a type of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, specifically CDG-Ib. This rare inherited metabolic disorder is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal problems, failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, and coagulation abnormalities. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely among individuals affected by this disorder. CDG-Ib is unique among CDGs as it can be treated effectively with oral mannose supplements, which bypass the enzymatic block caused by MOGS deficiency.

For more detailed information on MOGS and its associated disease, CDG-Ib, the following key references are recommended:
