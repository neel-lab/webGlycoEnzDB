Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGY: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGY (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class Y) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are critical for attaching various proteins to the cell membrane, and they play significant roles in numerous cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune responses.

PIGY functions in an early stage of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. It is involved in the addition of ethanolamine phosphate to the first mannose of the GPI precursor. This step is essential for the formation of the core structure of GPI anchors, which ultimately serves as the link between specific proteins and the cell membrane.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGY works alongside other enzymes in a complex process to assemble GPI anchors. Proper GPI anchor synthesis is crucial for the correct expression and functioning of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules.

While there are no widely recognized diseases directly linked to mutations in the PIGY gene, defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis can lead to a group of rare genetic disorders known as GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). These disorders can manifest with a variety of symptoms, including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. The involvement of PIGY in the GPI biosynthesis pathway underscores its potential significance in these disorders.

For more detailed information on PIGY and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
