### Function

Human FUT9 (fucosyltransferase 9) is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a fucose residue in an α1,3 linkage to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This activity is essential for the synthesis of Lewis X (Lex) antigens, which play a critical role in cell-cell interactions, particularly in the development of the nervous system. FUT9 is unique among fucosyltransferases for its specific role in the creation of Lex antigens, which are involved in various cellular recognition processes.

### Reaction Pathways

FUT9 is part of the broader fucosylation pathway, where it specifically acts on lactosamine chains, adding a fucose residue to form the Lex structure. This fucosylation process is crucial in the generation of glycan epitopes that facilitate cell-cell adhesion and signaling, particularly in embryonic development and neurogenesis. Unlike other fucosyltransferases, FUT9 has a high specificity for the distal GlcNAc residue on polylactosamine chains, making it critical for the precise formation of Lex antigens.pdf】.

### Location

FUT9 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it performs its glycosylation functions. The Golgi apparatus is the central hub for protein and lipid modification within the cell, making it the ideal location for FUT9 to interact with its substrates and other glycosyltransferases involved in complex glycan synthesis. This localization is vital for ensuring that the glycan structures synthesized by FUT9 are correctly processed and functional when they reach the cell surface.

### Diseases

Alterations in FUT9 expression or function have been linked to various neurological disorders. Given its role in neurodevelopment, abnormalities in FUT9 can affect the formation of Lex antigens, which may disrupt normal brain development and function. Additionally, studies suggest that dysregulation of FUT9 could contribute to certain cancers, as changes in glycosylation patterns are often observed in tumor cells, potentially affecting their ability to proliferate, invade, and evade the immune system.pdf】.

In summary, FUT9 is a key enzyme in the synthesis of Lex antigens, with a critical role in neurodevelopment and cell signaling. Its localization in the Golgi apparatus ensures proper glycosylation, with significant implications for diseases related to the nervous system and cancer.
