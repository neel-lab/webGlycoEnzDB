Write a 100-350 word essay about human B3GNT8: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.



Human B3GNT8, known as beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 8, is a critical enzyme in the synthesis of complex glycan structures. It specifically acts on tetraantennary N-glycans and is involved in the elongation of polylactosamine chains. B3GNT8, through its interaction with B3GNT2, significantly enhances the synthetic activity of polylactosamine, an important component of glycoconjugates​​​​.

The B3GNT8 gene is located on chromosome 19 at 19q13.2. The enzyme is a type II membrane-bound protein, transferring GlcNAc to the nonreducing terminus of the Galβ1-4GlcNAc of tetraantennary N-glycans, either with or without a core fucose​​. B3GNT8's activity is essential for the formation of complex glycan structures, impacting various biological processes.

In terms of tissue distribution, B3GNT8 shows broad expression in human tissues, with high expression in the lung, throat, and ileum, and low expression in the tongue, breast, uterus, and testis​​. Notably, the expression level of B3GNT8 is significantly enhanced in tumor tissues, such as colon cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology. In colon cancer cell lines, B3GNT8 has been observed to be involved in the synthesis of polylactosamine on β1-6 branched N-glycans, which could be related to the malignancy of colon cancer​​.

Despite its involvement in cancer-related pathways, there have been no reports of human diseases directly caused by the loss of B3GNT8 gene function. Research into the role of B3GNT8 in cancer and other diseases is ongoing, with future perspectives focusing on its potential involvement in the malignancy of colon cancer by synthesizing polylactosamines on β1-6 branched N-glycans​​.

For further in-depth information on human B3GNT8, the following key references are recommended:

Huang et al. (2004): First report of human B3GNT8 sequence.
Ishida et al. (2005): Gene cloning and first enzymatic characterization of human B3GNT8.
Seko and Yamashita (2005): First report of B3GNT2/B3GNT8 heterocomplex​​.
