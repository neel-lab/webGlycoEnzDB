Write a 100-350 word essay about human NANS: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human NANS (N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids, a family of nine-carbon sugar acids that play crucial roles in various biological processes. NANS specifically catalyzes the condensation of N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the most common form of sialic acid.

Located predominantly in the cytoplasm, NANS is integral to the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, which is essential for the post-translational modification of proteins and lipids. Sialic acids, added to glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids, are crucial for cellular recognition, signaling, and stability. They play important roles in the immune response, cell-cell adhesion, and are also involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases.

Deficiency or dysfunction in NANS leads to sialic acid storage diseases (SASDs) like Salla disease and infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD). These are rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of free sialic acid in lysosomes. Clinical manifestations include developmental delay, hypotonia, and neurological deterioration. While Salla disease presents a milder phenotype, ISSD is more severe and often fatal in early childhood.

For more detailed information on NANS and its associated diseases, the following key references are recommended:
