### Function
Human ALG6 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 6) is a glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a vital role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. ALG6 specifically functions as a dolichyl-P-glucose:Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase, catalyzing the addition of the first glucose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. This step is essential for the proper assembly and maturation of glycoproteins, impacting their folding and stability.

### Reaction Pathways
The reaction pathway of ALG6 involves transferring glucose from dolichyl-phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) to the oligosaccharide intermediate Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This enzymatic activity results in the formation of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This initial glucosylation step is crucial as it serves as a substrate for subsequent glucosylation steps by ALG8 and ALG10, leading to the final Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol structure. This fully assembled oligosaccharide is then transferred to nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the ER lumen.

### Location
ALG6 is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) membrane, where it integrates into the membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. This strategic positioning allows ALG6 to access its substrates, Dol-P-Glc and the oligosaccharide precursor, facilitating efficient glycosylation. The ER is the primary site for the early stages of glycoprotein synthesis, where the initial assembly and modification of glycan structures occur.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG6 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ic (ALG6-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG6-CDG include psychomotor retardation, developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia, coagulopathy, feeding problems, and visual impairment. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG6 is a crucial enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, facilitating the initial glucosylation step necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER and its role in glycan assembly underscore its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG6 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in human health.
