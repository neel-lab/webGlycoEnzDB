Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST3GAL2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ST3GAL2 (ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates, essential components in a variety of biological processes. ST3GAL2 specifically catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to the terminal galactose residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids, forming alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid structures.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST3GAL2 is involved in the sialylation process, which is crucial for modulating the molecular interactions and functionalities of glycoconjugates. Sialic acids, added by ST3GAL2, are important for a wide range of cellular functions, including cell-cell recognition, signaling, and immune response. These modifications can affect the physical properties of cell surfaces, alter ligand-receptor interactions, and influence the stability and half-life of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

The expression and activity of ST3GAL2 have implications in various physiological and pathological conditions. Altered sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL2 have been associated with several diseases. For instance, dysregulated sialylation is implicated in cancer progression, where changes in cell surface glycosylation can impact tumor cell behavior, including invasion, metastasis, and evasion of immune surveillance.

Additionally, abnormal sialylation patterns may contribute to autoimmune disorders, as changes in glycan structures can affect immune cell recognition and activation. However, direct links between specific diseases and ST3GAL2 mutations are less documented, and further research is needed to elucidate these associations fully.

For more detailed information on ST3GAL2, its function, and its role in disease, the following key references are recommended:
