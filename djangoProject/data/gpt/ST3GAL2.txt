### Function
Human ST3GAL2, or ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2, is an enzyme that facilitates the addition of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Specifically, it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid in an alpha-2,3 linkage to galactose residues on N-linked and O-linked glycans. This sialylation process is crucial for modifying the biological properties of glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune recognition.

### Reaction Pathways
ST3GAL2 functions within the sialylation pathway, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from the donor molecule CMP-sialic acid to terminal galactose residues on glycan structures. These sialylated glycans are involved in various biological processes, such as the regulation of cell surface receptors, protection of proteins from degradation, and modulation of immune responses. The activity of ST3GAL2 ensures that glycoproteins and glycolipids are properly sialylated, which is critical for their stability and function in cellular communication.

### Location
ST3GAL2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the final stages of glycoprotein and glycolipid modification. The Golgi is the key cellular organelle for the post-translational modification of proteins and lipids, and the presence of ST3GAL2 in the Golgi membrane allows it to efficiently sialylate glycan structures as they are processed and sorted for their final destinations. This localization is essential for the proper functioning of the sialylation pathway.

### Diseases
Dysregulation or altered expression of ST3GAL2 has been associated with various diseases, particularly cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, abnormal sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL2 can promote tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion, contributing to the progression and aggressiveness of certain cancers. Additionally, changes in sialylation have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, where altered glycosylation patterns can affect neural function and cell signaling. Understanding the role of ST3GAL2 in these processes is important for developing therapeutic strategies targeting abnormal sialylation in these diseases.
