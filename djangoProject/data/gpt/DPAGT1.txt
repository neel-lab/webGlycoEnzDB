Human DPAGT1 (Dolichyl-Phosphate (UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine) N-Acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1) is an essential enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a critical process in protein modification and maturation. DPAGT1 catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) by adding N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol phosphate (dol-P). This enzyme is fundamental for N-linked protein glycosylation and is considered a key regulator in the metabolic pathway of protein N-glycosylation​​.

DPAGT1 plays a vital role in various glycosylation processes, including protein O-glycosylation, O-GlcNAcylation, the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, and proteoglycans. Given its unique function, DPAGT1 is recognized as a central regulator of cellular glycoprotein biosynthesis. The gene encoding DPAGT1 is conserved across eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells, highlighting its evolutionary importance​​.

Mutations in DPAGT1 can lead to severe congenital disorders. Notably, defects in DPAGT1 cause the congenital disorder of glycosylation CDG-Ij (DPAGT1-CDG). Patients with this condition exhibit severe clinical manifestations, including muscular hypotonia, intractable seizures, developmental delay, mental retardation, and microcephaly. Unfortunately, most of these patients die within the first few years of life. Additionally, mutations in DPAGT1 have been reported to cause Limb-Girdle congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), an inherited disorder characterized by muscle weakness​​.

For more detailed information on human DPAGT1, the following key references are recommended:
