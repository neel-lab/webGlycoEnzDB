### Function
Human PGAP4, or Post-GPI Attachment to Proteins 4, is an enzyme involved in the remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that tether certain proteins to the cell membrane. PGAP4 specifically plays a role in the modification of GPI anchors after their initial attachment to proteins, ensuring that these proteins are correctly anchored and function properly on the cell surface.

### Reaction Pathways
PGAP4 functions within the GPI-anchor remodeling pathway, a crucial process for the maturation and function of GPI-anchored proteins. After the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PGAP4 participates in the modification of these anchors, which is necessary for their proper placement and stability on the cell membrane. This remodeling is essential for the correct localization and activity of GPI-anchored proteins, which are involved in various cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

### Location
PGAP4 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where proteins are synthesized, folded, and modified. The ER is the site of initial GPI anchor attachment to proteins, and PGAP4’s role in this organelle is critical for ensuring that GPI-anchored proteins are properly processed before they are transported to the Golgi apparatus and eventually to the cell surface. This localization is key to PGAP4’s function in GPI-anchor maturation.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PGAP4 gene have been linked to intellectual disability and other developmental abnormalities. These mutations can disrupt the proper remodeling of GPI anchors, leading to mislocalized or non-functional GPI-anchored proteins. The resulting defects in cell signaling, adhesion, and immune function contribute to the clinical manifestations of the disease. Understanding PGAP4’s role in GPI-anchor processing is important for diagnosing and potentially treating disorders associated with abnormal GPI anchoring and related cellular dysfunctions.
