Write a 100-350 word essay about human PGAP4: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PGAP4 (Post-GPI Attachment to Proteins 4) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis and remodeling of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are complex glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell surface. PGAP4 specifically functions in the maturation process of GPI-anchored proteins, which involves the deacylation of inositol-linked acyl chains in GPI anchors. This enzymatic action is essential for the proper expression and function of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface.

PGAP4 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it modulates the structure of GPI anchors attached to proteins. This structural modification is crucial as it affects the properties of the anchored proteins, including their sorting, trafficking, and function on the cell surface. GPI-anchored proteins play diverse roles, including in signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

Dysfunction in PGAP4 has been associated with intellectual disability and developmental disorders. Specifically, mutations in the PGAP4 gene can lead to hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), a rare condition characterized by elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological symptoms. The link between PGAP4 deficiency and HPMRS highlights the importance of GPI anchor remodeling in neural development and function.

For more detailed information on PGAP4 and its role in GPI anchor remodeling, the following key references are recommended:
