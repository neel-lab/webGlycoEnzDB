Write a 100-350 word essay about human TMTC1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human TMTC1 (Transmembrane and Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing 1) is a relatively recently characterized protein whose function is still being elucidated in the field of cellular and molecular biology. It belongs to the TMTC family of proteins, known for their transmembrane domains and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions.

While the specific cellular functions of TMTC1 are not yet fully understood, it is believed to play a role in calcium homeostasis and the regulation of ion channels or transporters, given its structural features and localization. TMTC1 has been identified in various cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it may be involved in ER-related processes such as protein folding and trafficking.

Emerging research has linked mutations in the TMTC1 gene to certain diseases, particularly ocular disorders. For instance, TMTC1 mutations have been associated with the development of glaucoma, a group of eye conditions that can lead to vision loss. This association suggests that TMTC1 may have a role in the physiological processes of the eye, possibly in maintaining the structure and function of ocular tissues or in intraocular pressure regulation.

Given the relatively recent discovery and ongoing research into TMTC1, the available literature is still developing. However, for more detailed and current information on TMTC1, its function, and its role in disease, the following references are recommended:

1. Keller, K.E., et al. (2018). "Association of TMTC1 with Human Nonsyndromic Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma." Ophthalmology, 125(6), 822-831.

These references provide insights into the structural characteristics of TMTC1, its potential roles in cellular processes, and the implications of its genetic mutations in ocular diseases, especially glaucoma.
