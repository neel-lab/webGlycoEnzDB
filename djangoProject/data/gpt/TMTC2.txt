Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human TMTC2. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human TMTC2 (Transmembrane and Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing 2) is a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), believed to play a role in the regulation of protein glycosylation and quality control. Like its homolog TMTC1, TMTC2 contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. TMTC2 is thought to interact with components of the glycosylation machinery, influencing the proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins within the ER.

### Reaction Pathways
TMTC2 is likely involved in the N-glycosylation pathway, which is essential for the attachment of carbohydrate moieties to nascent proteins. This process is critical for the structural integrity and function of glycoproteins. While the exact mechanisms of TMTC2's involvement are still under investigation, it is proposed to play a role in ensuring that glycoproteins are correctly glycosylated and folded, possibly through interactions with the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex or other glycosylation-related enzymes within the ER.

### Location
TMTC2 is localized in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions in close proximity to other proteins involved in glycoprotein synthesis and processing. The ER is the site of protein synthesis, folding, and post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. TMTC2’s ER localization is essential for its role in overseeing the quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins, ensuring that they are properly modified before being sent to their final destinations within the cell.

### Diseases
Mutations in the TMTC2 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB84B). This condition suggests that TMTC2 plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the auditory system, potentially through its involvement in glycoprotein processing. The exact mechanism by which TMTC2 mutations lead to hearing loss is not fully understood, but it is likely related to disruptions in glycosylation and protein folding in the cells of the inner ear. Further research is needed to clarify TMTC2’s broader role in human health and its potential implications in other diseases related to glycosylation defects.
