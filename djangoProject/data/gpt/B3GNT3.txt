Human B3GNT3 (Beta-1,3-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates, particularly in the formation and elongation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. These carbohydrate chains are key components of glycoproteins and glycolipids, integral to various cellular functions.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
B3GNT3 catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to galactose residues, forming the core structure of poly-N-acetyllactosamine. This structure is a critical part of branched oligosaccharides in both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation. The extended lactosamine chains synthesized by B3GNT3 are found on a variety of cell surface glycoproteins and are involved in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and signaling. These chains play a role in numerous biological processes, including immune response, cell differentiation, and development.

Location:
B3GNT3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular site where glycosylation, a form of post-translational modification, occurs. The Golgi apparatus is crucial for the biosynthesis and modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids, and B3GNT3's role here is integral to these processes.

Diseases:
Disruptions in the function of B3GNT3 can potentially impact the formation of glycoconjugates, leading to abnormalities in cell signaling and adhesion. While specific diseases directly caused by mutations in B3GNT3 are not well-documented, its critical role in glycosylation suggests that dysfunction could contribute to developmental disorders, immune dysregulation, and possibly certain cancers where cell surface glycosylation is altered.

Key References:
For more detailed information on B3GNT3, consider the following references:
