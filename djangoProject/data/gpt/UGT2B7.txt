### Function
Human UGT2B7, or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7, is an essential enzyme involved in the detoxification and metabolism of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds through glucuronidation. UGT2B7 catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid to various substrates, including steroid hormones, fatty acids, bilirubin, and numerous drugs, such as opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This glucuronidation process enhances the solubility of these compounds, facilitating their excretion from the body and thereby helping to regulate their activity and prevent toxicity.

### Reaction Pathways
UGT2B7 operates within the glucuronidation pathway, a crucial phase II metabolic process. The enzyme transfers glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amino groups on its substrates. UGT2B7 is particularly important in the metabolism of opioids, such as morphine, converting them into more water-soluble glucuronides, which are less active and more easily excreted. This enzymatic activity is vital for the detoxification and clearance of a wide variety of potentially harmful substances, including bilirubin and therapeutic drugs.

### Location
UGT2B7 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a central role in drug metabolism and the detoxification of endogenous compounds. It is also found in other tissues, including the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. The enzyme's hepatic expression is critical for the systemic metabolism of circulating substances, while its presence in other tissues suggests a broader role in localized detoxification processes.

### Diseases
Variations in UGT2B7 activity, often due to genetic polymorphisms, can significantly impact the metabolism of drugs and endogenous substances, potentially leading to altered drug efficacy and an increased risk of adverse effects. For example, individuals with reduced UGT2B7 activity may experience higher levels of active opioids in their system, leading to an increased risk of opioid toxicity. Additionally, impaired UGT2B7 function can contribute to conditions like hyperbilirubinemia, where elevated bilirubin levels can cause jaundice. Understanding UGT2B7â€™s role is essential for optimizing drug therapy and managing conditions related to impaired glucuronidation.
