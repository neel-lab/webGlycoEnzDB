Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT2B7: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT2B7 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B7) is an essential enzyme in the body's detoxification system, playing a critical role in the metabolism of a wide range of compounds. As a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, UGT2B7 specializes in the glucuronidation process, a major phase II metabolic pathway. This pathway involves the conjugation of glucuronic acid to substances such as drugs, hormones, and other lipophilic endogenous and exogenous compounds, thereby enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion.

UGT2B7 is primarily expressed in the liver, the central organ for drug metabolism, but its presence is also noted in other tissues like the kidney and brain. This enzyme is pivotal in the metabolism of a broad range of clinically important drugs, including opioids (like morphine and codeine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antiretroviral drugs. By converting these substances into more water-soluble glucuronide conjugates, UGT2B7 aids in their elimination from the body, playing a vital role in drug detoxification and clearance.

Genetic polymorphisms in the UGT2B7 gene can significantly influence the enzyme's activity and expression, leading to interindividual variability in drug metabolism. These genetic variations can impact drug efficacy and toxicity, affecting therapeutic outcomes, especially in the case of pain management with opioids and the treatment of chronic diseases with NSAIDs or antiretrovirals.

In addition to drug metabolism, UGT2B7 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous compounds, including steroid hormones and bile acids. Alterations in UGT2B7 activity may therefore have implications for hormone-related disorders and diseases involving bile acid dysregulation.

For more detailed information on UGT2B7, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
