### Function
Human ST3GAL4, or ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4, is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. It specifically adds sialic acid in an alpha-2,3 linkage to galactose residues on N-linked and O-linked glycans. This sialylation process is crucial for determining the biological properties of glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing their roles in cell-cell interactions, immune responses, and the stabilization of cell surface molecules.

### Reaction Pathways
ST3GAL4 functions within the sialylation pathway, where it transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid, the donor molecule, to the terminal galactose residues on glycan chains. The resulting sialylated glycans play essential roles in various cellular processes, including modulation of cell adhesion, regulation of receptor activity, and protection of proteins from degradation. ST3GAL4’s activity is vital for producing functional glycoproteins and glycolipids that are involved in maintaining cell structure and communication.

### Location
ST3GAL4 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the organelle responsible for the post-translational modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, ST3GAL4 is strategically positioned to add sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids as they are processed and prepared for transport to the cell surface or other cellular compartments. This localization is essential for ensuring that glycoproteins and glycolipids are properly sialylated, allowing them to function effectively in various cellular activities.

### Diseases
Altered expression or mutations in the ST3GAL4 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory disorders. In cancer, aberrant sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL4 can promote tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to immune detection by modifying cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Additionally, changes in ST3GAL4 activity have been linked to inflammatory diseases, where altered sialylation can affect immune cell signaling and responses. Understanding ST3GAL4’s role in these processes is important for developing targeted therapies for conditions related to abnormal sialylation.
