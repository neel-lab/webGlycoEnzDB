Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST3GAL4: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST3GAL4 (ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4) is an enzyme critical in the process of sialylation, a type of glycosylation that adds sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. ST3GAL4 specifically catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to the terminal galactose residues in glycoconjugates, forming alpha-2,3-sialic acid linkages. This modification is crucial for various biological functions and cellular processes.

ST3GAL4 is predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a key role in the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates. Sialylation by ST3GAL4 affects the physical and biological properties of cell surfaces, influencing cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and immune response. The enzyme is involved in the synthesis of sialyl-Lewis X (sLe^x) antigens, which are selectin ligands critical for leukocyte adhesion and migration during inflammatory responses.

Aberrant expression or dysfunction of ST3GAL4 can have significant implications in various pathological conditions. For instance, altered sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL4 are associated with cancer progression and metastasis. In cancer cells, changes in sialylation can affect tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and interactions with the immune system. Additionally, dysregulated ST3GAL4 expression may contribute to autoimmune diseases by altering immune cell recognition and activation.

While direct links between specific diseases and ST3GAL4 mutations are less documented, the enzyme's role in critical glycosylation processes suggests its potential involvement in various disorders, particularly those related to immune function and cancer.

For more detailed information on ST3GAL4, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
