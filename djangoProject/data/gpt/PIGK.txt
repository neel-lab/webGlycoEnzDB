### Function
Human PIGK, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class K, is an enzyme involved in the final step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that attach specific proteins to the cell membrane, playing key roles in signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGK is a crucial component of the GPI transamidase complex, which cleaves the signal peptide of a precursor protein and transfers the GPI anchor to the protein's newly exposed carboxyl terminus.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGK functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, particularly in the GPI transamidation process. This enzyme is part of a five-protein complex that performs the transamidation reaction, essential for attaching the preassembled GPI anchor to proteins. This step occurs after the GPI anchor is synthesized and ensures that GPI-anchored proteins are properly linked to the cell membrane, where they can perform their biological functions. The transamidation reaction facilitated by PIGK is vital for the correct localization and functionality of a wide range of proteins.

### Location
PIGK is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it operates as part of the GPI transamidase complex. The ER is responsible for the synthesis, folding, and modification of proteins, making it the ideal location for PIGK to facilitate the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. The proper function of PIGK in the ER is essential for the successful production and maturation of GPI-anchored proteins, which are then transported to the cell surface.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGK gene can lead to disorders known as inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), which are characterized by a variety of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. These disorders result from the improper attachment of GPI anchors to proteins, leading to their mislocalization and dysfunction. The inability of GPI-anchored proteins to function correctly due to PIGK mutations can disrupt numerous cellular processes, contributing to the clinical manifestations of IGDs. Understanding PIGKâ€™s role is crucial for diagnosing and developing treatments for these conditions.
