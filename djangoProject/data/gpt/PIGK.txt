Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGK: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGK (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class K) is an enzyme integral to the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are complex molecules that link proteins to cell membranes. PIGK is responsible for the addition of the second mannose to the GPI precursor, a critical step in the biosynthetic pathway of GPI anchors.

PIGK is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it participates in the early stages of GPI anchor assembly. GPI anchors are essential for the attachment and functionality of various proteins on the cell surface, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules. These GPI-anchored proteins play significant roles in numerous biological processes, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune responses.

Dysfunction or mutations in the genes involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis, including PIGK, can lead to GPI anchor deficiencies. These deficiencies can impact the proper expression and functionality of GPI-anchored proteins, leading to various health issues. While specific diseases directly linked to PIGK mutations are not as well-documented as those associated with some other GPI biosynthesis genes, general impairments in GPI anchor biosynthesis are known to cause several congenital disorders. Such disorders can present a range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays, underscoring the crucial role of GPI anchors in physiological processes and neural development.

For more information on PIGK and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
