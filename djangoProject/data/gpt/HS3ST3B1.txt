Human HS3ST3B1 (heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1) is an enzyme critically involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a type of glycosaminoglycan integral to cell signaling, development, and extracellular matrix structure. HS3ST3B1 specifically catalyzes the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate. This sulfation is a vital modification that influences the biological activity and specificity of HS, particularly in its interactions with proteins such as growth factors, chemokines, and morphogens.

HS3ST3B1 operates predominantly within the Golgi apparatus. In this cellular compartment, it modifies HS chains attached to core proteoglycans, contributing to the formation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs are essential components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, playing roles in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathway regulation.

The 3-O-sulfation conducted by HS3ST3B1, though less abundant than other sulfation patterns in HS, is crucial for specific biological functions. For example, it is instrumental in the regulation of various signaling pathways and in interactions with growth factors. This modification can also influence blood coagulation processes by affecting HS's interaction with antithrombin.

Dysfunction or aberrant expression of HS3ST3B1 can be implicated in various disease processes. Its role in developmental disorders, cancer progression, and coagulopathies is of particular interest. Alterations in HS structure due to changes in HS3ST3B1 activity can affect cell behavior, contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and abnormal developmental processes.
