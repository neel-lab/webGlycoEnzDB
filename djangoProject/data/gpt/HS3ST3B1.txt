### Function
Human HS3ST3B1, or heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1, is an enzyme involved in the modification of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan critical for a variety of cellular functions. HS3ST3B1 catalyzes the sulfation of glucosamine residues at the 3-O position within the heparan sulfate chains. This sulfation is essential for generating specific binding sites on heparan sulfate, which are necessary for its interaction with a variety of proteins, including those involved in blood coagulation, cell signaling, and viral entry.

### Reaction Pathways
HS3ST3B1 functions within the heparan sulfate biosynthesis pathway, where it adds a sulfate group to the 3-O position of glucosamine residues. This specific modification is crucial for the biological activity of heparan sulfate, enabling it to bind to proteins like antithrombin and chemokines, which play roles in processes such as anticoagulation and immune responses. Additionally, this 3-O-sulfation can affect the binding of growth factors and influence the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

### Location
HS3ST3B1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as part of the post-translational modification machinery that processes and sorts proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, HS3ST3B1 modifies heparan sulfate proteoglycans by adding the 3-O-sulfate group, ensuring that these molecules are fully functional when they reach the cell surface or extracellular matrix. The Golgi localization is essential for the enzyme to access its substrates and perform its specific sulfation tasks.

### Diseases
Alterations in the expression or function of HS3ST3B1 have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancer and viral infections. In cancer, dysregulated activity of HS3ST3B1 can lead to abnormal sulfation of heparan sulfate, which may contribute to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by affecting cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, viruses like herpes simplex virus exploit 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate for cell entry, highlighting HS3ST3B1 as a potential target for antiviral therapies. Understanding the role of HS3ST3B1 in these processes is vital for developing therapeutic strategies that modulate heparan sulfate function in disease contexts.
