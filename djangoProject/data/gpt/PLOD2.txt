Write a 100-350 word essay about human PLOD2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PLOD2 (Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis and modification of collagen, a fundamental structural protein in various connective tissues. PLOD2 is responsible for the hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen molecules, a process that is essential for the formation and stabilization of collagen fibrils.

Located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PLOD2 catalyzes the formation of hydroxylysine, which is a key step in the post-translational modification of collagen. Hydroxylation enhances the ability of collagen molecules to form stable cross-links, thereby contributing to the strength and integrity of the collagenous extracellular matrix found in skin, bones, tendons, and other connective tissues.

Deficiencies or dysfunctions in PLOD2 can lead to abnormalities in collagen synthesis and structure. While specific diseases directly linked to PLOD2 mutations are not extensively documented, alterations in collagen processing and structure can contribute to a range of connective tissue disorders. These may include conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, characterized by hypermobile joints, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility.

For more detailed information on PLOD2 and its role in connective tissue health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
