Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC2A3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC2A3, commonly known as GLUT3, is a facilitative glucose transporter with a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, particularly in the brain. GLUT3 is distinguished by its high affinity for glucose, allowing efficient glucose uptake even when extracellular glucose concentrations are low.

GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in neurons and is essential for providing a constant supply of glucose to the brain, which is crucial given the brain's high demand for glucose as its primary energy source. GLUT3's high affinity for glucose enables neurons to efficiently uptake glucose, ensuring their energy needs are met, especially during periods of high metabolic activity.

In addition to its neural expression, GLUT3 is also found in other tissues, including the placenta, where it plays a role in supplying glucose to the developing fetus. Its presence in spermatozoa suggests a role in ensuring energy supply for sperm motility.

Dysfunction or altered expression of GLUT3 can have significant implications, particularly in neurological function. While direct links to specific diseases are not extensively documented, aberrations in GLUT3 function could contribute to neurological disorders where glucose metabolism is impaired. This includes conditions such as ischemic stroke, where GLUT3-mediated glucose transport may be critical during periods of reduced blood flow.
