Write a 100-350 word essay about human AGA: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human AGA (Aspartylglucosaminidase) is an enzyme crucial in the catabolic pathway of glycoproteins. It plays a key role in the breakdown and recycling of glycoproteins within cells, particularly in the lysosomes.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
AGA specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosamine-asparagine linkages in glycoproteins. This process is a part of the sequential degradation of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins. The proper functioning of AGA is essential for the regular turnover and recycling of glycoproteins, ensuring the balance and homeostasis of cellular components.

Location:
AGA is predominantly located in lysosomes, the cellular organelles responsible for breaking down waste materials and cellular debris. Lysosomes are key to various cellular processes, including autophagy, and play a vital role in maintaining cellular health.

Diseases:
Mutations in the AGA gene can lead to a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder known as Aspartylglucosaminuria. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the AGA enzyme, leading to the accumulation of glycoprotein fragments in cells and tissues. The disorder primarily affects the central nervous system, leading to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and skeletal abnormalities. Aspartylglucosaminuria is more prevalent in certain populations, such as the Finnish population, where it has a higher incidence rate.

Key References:
For more detailed information on AGA, its function, and related diseases, consider the following key references:
