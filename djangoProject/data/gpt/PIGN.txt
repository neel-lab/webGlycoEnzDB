Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGN : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human PIGN (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class N) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are complex glycolipids that attach various proteins to the cell membrane, essential for diverse biological functions including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

PIGN is involved in an early stage of GPI anchor synthesis, particularly in the addition of a side branch to the growing GPI precursor. This step is crucial for the proper structure and function of the resulting GPI-anchored proteins. PIGN's activity ensures that GPI-anchored proteins are correctly assembled and functional, allowing them to be effectively presented on the cell surface.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGN is part of the intricate enzymatic process that constructs GPI anchors. Proper GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for the correct localization and functionality of a wide array of proteins on the cell surface.

Mutations in the PIGN gene have been associated with multiple congenital anomalies, leading to a range of developmental and neurological disorders. These conditions, part of a group known as GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs), can manifest with symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia, and congenital malformations. The involvement of PIGN in these disorders highlights its significant role in normal development and neurological function.

For more detailed information on PIGN and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
