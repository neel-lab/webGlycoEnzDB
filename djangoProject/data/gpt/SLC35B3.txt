Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35B3 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35B3 is a member of the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family, specifically functioning as a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) transporter. It plays a critical role in the process of glycosylation, a vital cellular function for the synthesis and modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, SLC35B3 is responsible for transporting UDP-GlcNAc from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen. Inside the Golgi, UDP-GlcNAc serves as a substrate for various glycosyltransferases that add GlcNAc to nascent glycoconjugates during their synthesis. This process is essential for the proper assembly and functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are crucial for a wide range of biological processes including cell signaling, immune responses, and protein stability.

The role of SLC35B3 in glycosylation makes it a key player in ensuring the structural integrity and functionality of various cellular components. Disruptions in the function of SLC35B3 can lead to abnormalities in glycosylation, potentially affecting multiple systems in the body. While specific diseases directly linked to SLC35B3 mutations or dysfunctions are not well-established, disruptions in glycosylation pathways have been known to contribute to various disorders, including congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). CDGs are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, leading to a wide range of symptoms depending on the severity and type of the glycosylation defect.

For more detailed information on SLC35B3, its function, and role in glycosylation, the following key references are recommended:
