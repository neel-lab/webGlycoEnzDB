Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGH: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human PIGH (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class H) is an enzyme that plays a vital role in the early stages of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are complex glycolipids that tether a variety of proteins to the cell surface, serving crucial functions in signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune responses.

PIGH is responsible for the addition of the first mannose to the GPI precursor. This step is a critical part of GPI anchor synthesis, setting the foundation for subsequent modifications that result in the complete, functional GPI anchor. The enzyme's action is essential for the proper assembly of GPI anchors, ensuring the correct attachment and presentation of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface.

PIGH is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it participates in the complex GPI biosynthetic pathway. Given the importance of GPI-anchored proteins in various cellular processes, PIGH plays a significant role in maintaining cellular functionality and communication.

Dysfunctions or mutations in PIGH can potentially lead to GPI anchor deficiencies, impacting the expression and function of GPI-anchored proteins. While specific diseases directly caused by PIGH mutations are not widely documented, GPI biosynthesis defects are known to result in several congenital disorders. These disorders often present with symptoms like developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizures, reflecting the importance of GPI anchors in developmental and neurological processes.

For more detailed information on PIGH and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
