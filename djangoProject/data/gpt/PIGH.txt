### Function
Human PIGH, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class H, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the early stages of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are essential for attaching specific proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating various cellular processes such as signaling, immune responses, and cell adhesion. PIGH is a part of the enzyme complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol, the first committed step in GPI anchor formation.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGH functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The enzyme is a component of a multi-subunit complex that initiates the synthesis of GPI anchors by transferring GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol. This step is crucial as it sets the foundation for the subsequent steps in GPI anchor assembly, where the anchor is elongated, modified, and eventually attached to proteins destined for the cell surface.

### Location
PIGH is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of protein synthesis and initial post-translational modifications. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGH to function as part of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex, ensuring the proper initiation of GPI anchor biosynthesis. This localization is essential for the enzyme’s role in the early stages of anchor formation, enabling the correct processing and modification of GPI-anchored proteins.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGH gene can lead to inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological problems. These disorders arise from defects in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, leading to the improper attachment and function of GPI-anchored proteins. As these proteins are critical for various cellular functions, their mislocalization or dysfunction can result in significant physiological and neurological challenges. Understanding PIGH’s role is vital for diagnosing and developing therapeutic approaches for these conditions.
