### Function
Human MGAT4C, or N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IVc, is an enzyme involved in the modification of N-glycans during glycoprotein biosynthesis. MGAT4C is believed to catalyze the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the alpha-1,3-linked mannose residues of glycoproteins, a key step in the formation of branched glycan structures. These branched N-glycans are crucial for various cellular functions, including protein stability, cell signaling, and immune responses, contributing to the proper function of glycoproteins.

### Reaction Pathways
MGAT4C operates within the N-glycosylation pathway, a critical post-translational modification process. Following the initial glycan processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi apparatus, MGAT4C acts in the Golgi to add GlcNAc to mannose residues on glycoproteins. This step is essential for the generation of complex, branched N-glycans, which are necessary for the proper folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins. These modifications play a significant role in determining the biological activity and cellular localization of glycoproteins, influencing processes such as cell-cell communication and protein trafficking.

### Location
MGAT4C is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the organelle responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins before they are transported to their final destinations within or outside the cell. The enzyme's position within the Golgi is crucial for its function in N-glycan branching, as it ensures that glycoproteins are accurately modified as they pass through the Golgi en route to their final cellular locations. This strategic localization allows MGAT4C to play a vital role in the final stages of glycoprotein processing.

### Diseases
The specific role of MGAT4C in human diseases is not as well characterized as other MGAT family members, but alterations in its activity could potentially contribute to disorders related to glycosylation, such as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). These disorders are often associated with a wide range of symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and immune deficiencies, due to improper glycosylation of proteins. Additionally, dysregulation of glycosylation enzymes like MGAT4C could play a role in cancer, where abnormal glycan structures on cell surface proteins may promote tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding the function of MGAT4C is essential for exploring its potential involvement in these conditions and for developing therapeutic strategies targeting glycosylation pathways.
