Write a 100-350 word essay about human MGAT4C: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human MGAT4C (Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 4C) is an enzyme implicated in the process of N-linked glycosylation, a fundamental cellular mechanism essential for the maturation and functioning of glycoproteins. Similar to other members of the MGAT family, MGAT4C is involved in adding N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues on the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins, facilitating the formation of complex and hybrid N-glycans.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MGAT4C plays a critical role in the structural diversification and proper folding of glycoproteins. This enzymatic modification is crucial for the stability and biological activity of a wide array of glycoproteins, which are integral to numerous cellular processes, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein trafficking.

While the direct association of MGAT4C with specific diseases is not as well-established as other glycosylation enzymes, disruptions in the N-linked glycosylation pathway can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of rare inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, leading to a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and immune system dysfunctions. Given its role in glycosylation, aberrations in MGAT4C function could potentially contribute to similar disorders, although such associations have yet to be clearly established in clinical research.

For more detailed information on MGAT4C and its role in glycoprotein processing, the following key references are recommended:
