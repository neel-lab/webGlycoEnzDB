Write a 100-350 word essay about human DPM1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human DPM1, or Dolichyl-Phosphate Mannosyltransferase Polypeptide 1, is an essential component of the enzyme complex responsible for the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man). This complex is crucial for various glycosylation pathways, including N-linked glycosylation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. DPM1 associates with DPM2 and DPM3 proteins to form a stable DPM synthase complex. This complex is responsible for transferring mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol phosphate, forming Dol-P-Man, which is a donor substrate for several glycosylation reactions in the ER​​​​.

Structurally, human DPM1 differs from its yeast counterpart, Dpm1p, and lacks a signal sequence or a transmembrane domain. In contrast, human DPM2 and DPM3 proteins contain two transmembrane helices with both N- and C-termini oriented towards the cytoplasm​​.

Mutations in the DPM1 gene have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Specifically, defects in the DPM1 gene cause CDG type Ie (DPM1-CDG). Patients with DPM1-CDG exhibit severe clinical manifestations, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and other systemic problems. For example, Kim et al. (2000) identified a homozygous mutation in the DPM1 gene that resulted in an Arg92-to-Gly substitution, leading to the disease. These findings highlight the importance of DPM1 in proper glycosylation and its impact on human health​​.
