### Function

Human DPM1 (dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase 1) is a critical enzyme involved in the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol-phosphate, forming Dol-P-Man. Dol-P-Man serves as a mannose donor for several glycosylation processes, including N-glycosylation, O-mannosylation, C-mannosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. These processes are essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

### Reaction Pathways

DPM1 operates within the glycosylation pathway by producing Dol-P-Man, which is a critical substrate for glycosylation reactions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specifically, Dol-P-Man is used in N-glycosylation to transfer mannose residues to growing glycan chains on nascent proteins. It is also involved in the synthesis of GPI anchors, which tether proteins to the cell membrane. Additionally, Dol-P-Man contributes to O-mannosylation and C-mannosylation pathways, which are vital for the proper functioning of various proteins and cell surface molecules.

### Location

DPM1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. It functions as part of a multi-subunit enzyme complex with DPM2 and DPM3, which help stabilize DPM1 and ensure its proper localization and activity within the ER. This membrane-bound localization is essential for its role in glycosylation, allowing it to efficiently interact with other components of the glycosylation machinery and substrates involved in these pathways.

### Diseases

Mutations in the DPM1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG-Ie. These disorders are characterized by defects in glycoprotein biosynthesis, leading to a range of symptoms including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and severe multisystemic issues. In addition, defects in DPM1 have been associated with muscular dystrophies, particularly those involving dystroglycanopathies, where the improper glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan affects muscle function and integrity.

In summary, DPM1 is a crucial enzyme in the glycosylation pathway, essential for the synthesis of Dol-P-Man and the proper glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Its function and localization in the ER are critical for cellular processes, and its deficiencies can lead to severe congenital disorders, highlighting its importance in human health.
