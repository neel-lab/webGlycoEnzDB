Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human FUT3. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function

Human FUT3 (fucosyltransferase 3) is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the Lewis blood group antigens, specifically the Lewis a (Lea) and Lewis b (Leb) antigens. FUT3 catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-fucose to precursor oligosaccharides in an α1,3 or α1,4 linkage. This action is essential for the formation of the Lea and Leb antigens, which play important roles in cell-cell recognition, immune response, and pathogen interaction .

### Reaction Pathways

FUT3 functions within the fucosylation pathway, where it specifically modifies Type 1 precursor oligosaccharides. FUT3 transfers fucose to the GlcNAc residues of these precursors, forming Lea antigens. In secretor-positive individuals, FUT2 first converts Type 1 units to Type 1 H determinants, which FUT3 can then modify to form Leb antigens. This sequence of reactions is critical for the proper expression of Lewis antigens on the cell surface  .

### Location

FUT3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it performs its glycosyltransferase function. The Golgi is the site of glycan modification, making it the optimal location for FUT3 to interact with its substrates and other glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of complex glycan structures. The proper functioning of FUT3 within the Golgi ensures that Lewis antigens are correctly synthesized and presented on the cell surface .

### Diseases

Mutations in the FUT3 gene can lead to the Lewis-negative phenotype, where individuals lack the expression of both Lea and Leb antigens. This condition occurs in approximately 10-20% of the population and can influence susceptibility to certain infections, such as Helicobacter pylori, which binds to Lewis antigens in the gastric mucosa. Additionally, altered expression of FUT3 has been observed in certain cancers, where changes in glycosylation patterns can affect tumor progression and metastasis .

In summary, FUT3 is a key enzyme in the synthesis of Lewis blood group antigens, functioning within the Golgi apparatus to modify glycan structures. Its role in disease, particularly in the context of infection and cancer, underscores the importance of fucosylation in human health.
