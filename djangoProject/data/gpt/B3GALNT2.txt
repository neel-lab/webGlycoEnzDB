Write a 100-350 word essay about human B3GALNT2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human B3GALNT2, beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, is an important enzyme in the biosynthesis of complex glycoconjugates. It is primarily involved in transferring N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) in a beta-1,3 linkage to form structures such as GalNAc-beta1-3GlcNAc (type I LacdiNAc). This reaction is key in the formation of specific glycan structures on proteins and lipids.

B3GALNT2 plays a crucial role in the synthesis of O-mannosylated glycans, a branch of glycoconjugates with significant biological importance. The enzyme's activity is particularly essential for the synthesis of laminin-binding glycan, which is critical for muscle and brain development. This is demonstrated by the involvement of B3GALNT2 in the functional glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a protein necessary for normal muscular and neurological development.

The gene for human B3GALNT2 is located on chromosome 1 (1q42.3) and consists of at least 12 exons. The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with higher expression observed in the testis, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, and ovary. In situ hybridization analysis in mice has shown expression in germ line cells of the testis.

B3GALNT2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), not in the Golgi apparatus. This localization is crucial for its function in glycosylation processes occurring within the ER. Mutations in B3GALNT2 can disrupt its proper localization and function, leading to defects in glycosylation and associated physiological processes.

For more detailed information on human B3GALNT2, the following references are recommended:

Hiruma et al. (2004): Studies on the structure and enzymatic function of B3GALNT2.
Stevens et al. (2013): Research on the role of B3GALNT2 in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and its significance in muscle and brain development.
Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010, 2013): Investigations into the function of B3GALNT2 in O-mannosylated glycan synthesis.
These sources provide a comprehensive understanding of the biochemical role of B3GALNT2 in glycosylation processes and its significance in human cell biology​​​​.
