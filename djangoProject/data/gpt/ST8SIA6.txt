Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST8SIA6: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST8SIA6 (ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 6) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), a unique and essential carbohydrate modification. ST8SIA6 catalyzes the addition of sialic acid residues to nascent glycoconjugates, contributing to the formation of PSA chains. These chains are attached primarily to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and play a critical role in modulating cell-cell interactions.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST8SIA6 is crucial for the elongation of PSA chains, impacting the adhesive properties of NCAM. This modification is particularly important in the nervous system, where PSA-NCAM is involved in processes such as neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and axonal growth. The polysialylation of NCAM, mediated by ST8SIA6, enables dynamic cellular interactions necessary for neural development and regeneration.

The dysfunction of ST8SIA6 can have significant implications for neurological health. Abnormalities in PSA synthesis, potentially due to altered ST8SIA6 activity, have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. These conditions can arise from impaired neural connectivity and synaptic function, which are influenced by PSA-NCAM levels.

In addition to its role in the nervous system, ST8SIA6 has been implicated in cancer biology. Altered expression of ST8SIA6 and resultant changes in PSA levels can affect cancer cell behavior, influencing tumor growth, metastasis, and immune system interactions.

For more detailed information on ST8SIA6, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
