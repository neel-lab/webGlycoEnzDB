### Function

Human DPM3 (dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase subunit 3) is an essential component of the dolichyl-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase complex. It functions primarily as a regulatory subunit that stabilizes the catalytic subunit DPM1 and ensures its proper localization and activity within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). DPM3 is crucial for the synthesis of Dol-P-Man, a mannose donor necessary for several glycosylation pathways, including N-glycosylation, O-mannosylation, C-mannosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis.

### Reaction Pathways

DPM3 participates in the glycosylation process by forming a complex with DPM1 and DPM2. This DPM complex catalyzes the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol-phosphate, resulting in the formation of Dol-P-Man. Dol-P-Man serves as a key substrate in the N-glycosylation pathway, where it donates mannose residues to growing oligosaccharide chains on nascent glycoproteins. Additionally, Dol-P-Man is critical for the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, which tether proteins to the cell membrane, and for O-mannosylation and C-mannosylation processes, which modify specific serine/threonine residues on proteins.

### Location

DPM3 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it operates as part of the Dol-P-Man synthase complex. The ER is the site of synthesis for many glycoproteins and glycolipids, making the positioning of DPM3 crucial for its role in glycosylation. The membrane-bound nature of DPM3 allows it to interact effectively with other glycosylation enzymes and substrates, facilitating the efficient production of Dol-P-Man and subsequent glycosylation reactions.

### Diseases

Mutations in the DPM3 gene can lead to severe congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ie. This disorder is characterized by defects in glycoprotein biosynthesis, leading to a wide range of symptoms including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and muscle weakness. Patients with DPM3-related CDG often exhibit a combined phenotype of CDG and dystroglycanopathies, reflecting the enzyme's role in multiple glycosylation pathways. These conditions underscore the critical importance of DPM3 in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions.

In summary, DPM3 is a crucial regulatory subunit of the Dol-P-Man synthase complex, vital for glycosylation pathways in the ER. Its proper function is essential for the stability and activity of the complex, and its deficiencies can lead to severe congenital disorders, highlighting its importance in human health.
