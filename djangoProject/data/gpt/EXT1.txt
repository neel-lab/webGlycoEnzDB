Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human EXT1. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function

Human EXT1 (exostosin-1) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a type of glycosaminoglycan. EXT1 is a glycosyltransferase that, together with EXT2, forms a complex responsible for polymerizing HS chains. This enzyme adds repeating units of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) to the growing HS chain. HS is crucial for various biological processes, including cell signaling, development, and tissue morphogenesis  .

### Reaction Pathways

The EXT1/EXT2 complex catalyzes the elongation of HS chains by alternately adding GlcNAc and GlcA units. This polymerization occurs on a core protein where a tetrasaccharide linker (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl) serves as the starting point. EXT1's role is particularly critical in initiating and maintaining the elongation process, ensuring that the HS chains are correctly assembled. The HS chains produced by EXT1/EXT2 are then modified by various sulfotransferases to create mature HS with specific patterns of sulfation that determine their binding properties and biological functions  .

### Location

EXT1 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus of the cell. Within this organelle, EXT1 forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with EXT2, which enhances its glycosyltransferase activity. The Golgi localization is vital for its function in the synthesis and modification of glycosaminoglycans, ensuring that newly synthesized HS chains are properly assembled and modified before being transported to their final destinations on the cell surface or extracellular matrix  .

### Diseases

Mutations in the EXT1 gene are predominantly associated with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple benign bone tumors called osteochondromas. These tumors typically form near the growth plates of long bones and can lead to skeletal deformities, restricted movement, and, in some cases, malignant transformation into chondrosarcoma. HME is an autosomal dominant disorder, with mutations in EXT1 accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. The condition highlights the critical role of EXT1 in normal skeletal development and the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation  .

In summary, human EXT1 is a pivotal enzyme in the synthesis of heparan sulfate, crucial for various cellular functions and development. Its Golgi localization facilitates the proper assembly of HS chains. Mutations in EXT1 can lead to hereditary multiple exostoses, emphasizing the enzyme's importance in skeletal health and development.
