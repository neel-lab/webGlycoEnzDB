Write a 100-350 word essay about human EXT1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human EXT1 (Exostosin Glycosyltransferase 1) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan essential for numerous biological functions. EXT1's role is crucial for cell signaling, growth, and development.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
EXT1 functions as a glycosyltransferase, catalyzing the elongation of the heparan sulfate chain, a process vital for its biological activity. It does this by adding alternating units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine to the growing polysaccharide chain. This enzymatic activity is essential for producing heparan sulfate with the correct structure necessary for its diverse roles, including binding to various growth factors, morphogens, and adhesion molecules. Heparan sulfate is critical for various processes such as cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, and blood coagulation.

Location:
EXT1 is located in the Golgi apparatus, where glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis occurs. The enzyme works in concert with other glycosyltransferases to ensure the proper assembly and modification of heparan sulfate chains.

Diseases:
Mutations in the EXT1 gene are associated with multiple osteochondromas (MO), previously known as hereditary multiple exostoses (HME). This genetic condition is characterized by the development of multiple benign bone tumors (osteochondromas) that can cause pain, deformity, and growth disturbances. Additionally, patients with MO have an increased risk of developing chondrosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. The defective biosynthesis of heparan sulfate due to EXT1 mutations is thought to disrupt normal bone growth and development, leading to the formation of these tumors.

Key References:
For more detailed information on EXT1, consider the following key references:

1. **"Multiple Osteochondromas: Mutation Update and Description of the Multiple Osteochondromas Mutation Database (MOdb)" by Jennes et al. in Human Mutation (2009).

2. **"Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans: Structure, Role, and Pharmacological Activity" by Volpi in Advances in Pharmacology (2006).
