Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT1A3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT1A3 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 1 Member A3) is an enzyme belonging to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism and detoxification of a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds. UGT1A3 specializes in the process of glucuronidation, a major phase II biotransformation pathway in humans.

UGT1A3 is predominantly expressed in the liver, though it is also present in other tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract. The enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of glucuronic acid to a range of substrates, including bile acids, steroids, drugs, and other xenobiotics. This glucuronidation reaction enhances the water solubility of these compounds, facilitating their excretion from the body.

The activity of UGT1A3 is particularly important in the metabolism and clearance of certain medications and bile acids. Variations in UGT1A3 activity can significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics, potentially influencing drug efficacy and risk of adverse effects. For instance, individuals with certain UGT1A3 polymorphisms may exhibit altered metabolism of drugs that are UGT1A3 substrates, requiring dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic effectiveness or to avoid toxicity.

Dysfunction or genetic variations in UGT1A3 have been linked to several diseases. For example, aberrant UGT1A3 activity can contribute to disorders of bilirubin metabolism, such as Gilbert's syndrome, where reduced glucuronidation leads to hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, altered glucuronidation of bile acids may be implicated in cholestatic liver diseases.

For more detailed information on UGT1A3, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
