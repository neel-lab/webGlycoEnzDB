Write a 100-350 word essay about human IDS: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) is a critical lysosomal enzyme encoded by the IDS gene, playing a vital role in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The deficiency of IDS leads to a pathological accumulation of these GAGs, causing a variety of health issues.

Functionally, IDS is responsible for the hydrolysis of the 2-sulfate groups from the L-iduronic acid residues in dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the normal breakdown and turnover of these GAGs, which are complex carbohydrates involved in numerous cellular functions, including cell signaling, tissue repair, and maintaining structural integrity.

IDS participates in the lysosomal degradation pathway of GAGs. The lack of functional IDS impairs the breakdown of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, leading to their accumulation within lysosomes. This accumulation disrupts normal cellular function and can result in cellular and tissue damage.

IDS is located in lysosomes, the cellular organelles responsible for breaking down various biomolecules. Lysosomes act as the cell's waste disposal system, and enzymes like IDS are key to their efficient functioning.

Diseases associated with IDS deficiency fall under mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type II, also known as Hunter syndrome. MPS II is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including skeletal abnormalities, developmental delay, and, in severe cases, neurological impairment. Unlike some other forms of MPS, MPS II is more prevalent in males due to its X-linked genetic pattern.

For more detailed information on IDS, the following key references are recommended:

"Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (Hunter Syndrome): Clinical Picture and Treatment" in the journal "Current Pharmaceutical Design" for comprehensive information on the disease caused by IDS deficiency.
"Lysosomal Storage Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment" in the Journal of the American Medical Association for clinical insights into diseases related to lysosomal enzyme deficiencies.
"The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease" for an in-depth understanding of metabolic pathways affected by enzyme deficiencies.
"Essentials of Glycobiology" (3rd Edition) by A. Varki, R.D. Cummings, J.D. Esko, et al., for a broad overview of glycosaminoglycans and their metabolism.
These resources will provide comprehensive insights into the role of IDS in human physiology and its association with mucopolysaccharidosis type II.
