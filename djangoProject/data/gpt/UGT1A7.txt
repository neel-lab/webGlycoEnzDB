Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT1A7: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT1A7 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 1 Member A7) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the body's detoxification system. UGT1A7, part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme family, is involved in the glucuronidation process, wherein it catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid to a variety of substrates, including some environmental carcinogens, drugs, and endogenous compounds.

UGT1A7 is predominantly expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and colon. Its function in these tissues is primarily in the detoxification and metabolism of certain carcinogens present in food and the environment, as well as in the metabolism of specific drugs. By conjugating glucuronic acid to these compounds, UGT1A7 enhances their solubility, facilitating their excretion from the body and reducing their potential toxicity.

The activity of UGT1A7 and its genetic polymorphisms are of particular interest in pharmacogenetics and disease risk. Variations in the UGT1A7 gene can significantly affect the enzyme's activity, influencing an individual's susceptibility to certain cancers, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract. For example, specific polymorphisms in the UGT1A7 gene have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal and gastric cancers, likely due to the reduced ability to detoxify carcinogens.

Moreover, UGT1A7's role in drug metabolism implicates it in the variability of drug responses among individuals. Genetic differences in UGT1A7 can lead to variations in the efficacy and toxicity of medications metabolized by this enzyme, affecting therapeutic outcomes.

For more detailed information on UGT1A7, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
