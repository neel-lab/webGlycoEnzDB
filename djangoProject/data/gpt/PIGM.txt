Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGM: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGM (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class M) is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are complex molecules that attach a diverse range of proteins to the cell surface, playing crucial roles in various cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune regulation.

PIGM is specifically responsible for the transfer of a mannose molecule from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) to the growing GPI precursor, a key step in the GPI biosynthetic pathway. This mannose transfer is essential for the formation of the core glycan structure of GPI anchors.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGM's activity is critical for the correct assembly and functionality of GPI-anchored proteins. These proteins include enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules that are vital for numerous biological processes. The proper expression and localization of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface are dependent on the GPI anchor biosynthesis, in which PIGM plays an integral part.

While there are no widely recognized diseases directly linked to PIGM dysfunction, defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis can lead to a group of rare genetic disorders known as GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). Patients with GPIBDs can exhibit a range of symptoms, such as intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays, depending on the specific GPI anchor protein affected. The involvement of PIGM in GPI anchor synthesis underscores its potential significance in these disorders.

For more information on PIGM and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
