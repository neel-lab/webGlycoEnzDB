### Function
Human PIGM, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class M, is an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that attach specific proteins to the cell membrane, playing crucial roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune responses, and cell adhesion. PIGM specifically catalyzes the transfer of the first mannose to the GPI anchor precursor, a critical step in the formation of functional GPI anchors.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGM operates within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It functions as part of a complex that transfers the first mannose from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) to the GPI precursor, GlcNAc-inositol phospholipid. This mannose addition is essential for the subsequent steps in the GPI biosynthesis pathway, including further mannose additions and modifications that complete the GPI anchor structure. Proper functioning of PIGM is crucial for the successful assembly of GPI anchors, ensuring that proteins are correctly attached to the cell membrane.

### Location
PIGM is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where the initial stages of GPI anchor biosynthesis take place. The ER provides the necessary environment and substrates for PIGM to catalyze the mannose transfer, a key step in the GPI anchor formation process. PIGM’s location in the ER ensures it can efficiently interact with other components of the GPI biosynthesis machinery, facilitating the proper assembly and modification of GPI anchors.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGM gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), particularly a rare disorder known as inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency. This condition is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and an increased risk of venous thrombosis. The disorder arises because mutations in PIGM disrupt the normal biosynthesis of GPI anchors, leading to defects in protein attachment to the cell membrane and subsequent cellular dysfunction. Understanding PIGM’s role is crucial for diagnosing and developing treatments for these conditions.
