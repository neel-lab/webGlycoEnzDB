Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human NEU3. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human NEU3, or neuraminidase 3, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids. NEU3 specifically hydrolyzes terminal sialic acid residues from these sialoglycoconjugates, which is essential for regulating cell surface interactions, signal transduction, and immune responses. NEU3's activity is particularly important in modulating the composition of gangliosides, a type of glycolipid, on the cell membrane, influencing processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### Reaction Pathways
NEU3 functions primarily in the degradation of gangliosides and other sialylated molecules within the plasma membrane. By removing sialic acids, NEU3 alters the structure and function of these molecules, affecting how cells interact with their environment and communicate with each other. This enzymatic activity is a key part of the broader glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway, which is vital for maintaining the balance of complex lipids on the cell surface, influencing cellular behavior and signaling.

### Location
NEU3 is predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, where it associates with lipid raftsâ€”specialized microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. This membrane localization allows NEU3 to directly modify cell surface sialylated molecules, particularly gangliosides, thereby playing a significant role in modulating cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways. NEU3's activity at the cell surface distinguishes it from other neuraminidases like NEU1, which are primarily lysosomal.

### Diseases
Alterations in NEU3 activity have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Overexpression of NEU3 has been observed in several types of cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis by modifying cell surface glycosphingolipids. Additionally, NEU3 dysregulation can affect immune responses and has been linked to conditions such as atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases, where abnormal sialylation patterns play a role in disease pathology. Understanding NEU3's function and regulation is crucial for exploring therapeutic strategies targeting sialic acid metabolism in these diseases.
