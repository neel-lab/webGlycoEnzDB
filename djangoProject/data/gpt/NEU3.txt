Write a 100-350 word essay about human NEU3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human NEU3 (Sialidase-3 or Neuraminidase 3) is a crucial enzyme in the metabolism of sialic acids, particularly involved in the catabolism of gangliosides, which are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids. NEU3 specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues from gangliosides, a process essential for the regulation of these complex lipids in cellular membranes.

Predominantly associated with cell membranes, NEU3 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, distinguishing it from other sialidases localized in lysosomes or cytosol. This unique localization implicates NEU3 in the modulation of cell surface properties and signaling. Its enzymatic activity influences a range of cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, mainly due to its role in modifying the composition of gangliosides in the cell membrane.

Alterations in NEU3 activity have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. Overexpression of NEU3 has been observed in several types of cancers and is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression by altering cell membrane composition and associated signaling pathways. Additionally, NEU3 activity has implications in metabolic regulation, potentially influencing insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.

For more detailed information on NEU3, its function, and associated diseases, the following key references are recommended:
