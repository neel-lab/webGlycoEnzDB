Write a 100-350 word essay about human MAN1A1 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human GXYLT1, or Glucoside α1-3 Xylosyltransferase 1, is an enzyme involved in post-translational modification of proteins, particularly in the process of Notch signaling.

Function
GXYLT1 is responsible for adding xylose residues to O-glucose-modified proteins. Specifically, it functions in the modification of the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor, a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various developmental processes and cell fate decisions.

Reaction Pathways
GXYLT1 participates in the modification of the Notch receptor by adding xylose residues to O-glucose on specific epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats present in the extracellular domain of Notch. These modifications can influence the interaction of Notch with its ligands and thus modulate Notch signaling. Notch signaling is involved in a wide range of developmental and physiological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

Location
GXYLT1, as a glycosyltransferase, is likely located in the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, it adds sugar residues to proteins, a process essential for the proper function and localization of many membrane and secreted proteins.

Related Diseases
While specific diseases directly associated with GXYLT1 dysfunction are not detailed in my knowledge source, abnormalities in Notch signaling, potentially due to altered function of enzymes like GXYLT1, are linked to various developmental disorders and diseases. These include certain types of cancer, congenital disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.
