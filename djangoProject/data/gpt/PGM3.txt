Write a 100-350 word essay about human PGM3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PGM3 (Phosphoglucomutase 3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism, specifically in the synthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a fundamental building block for glycosylation processes. PGM3 catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P), an essential step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of UDP-GlcNAc.

Located primarily in the cytoplasm, PGM3 is involved in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is integral to the production of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Glycosylation, the addition of sugar moieties to proteins and lipids, is crucial for various cellular processes including cell signaling, immune response, and protein stability.

Deficiency or dysfunction in PGM3 has been linked to a rare congenital disorder known as PGM3-CDG (Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation), characterized by severe immunodeficiency, developmental delay, skeletal abnormalities, and other systemic issues. This condition underscores the importance of PGM3 in immune function and development, as proper glycosylation is essential for normal cellular and organ function.

For more detailed information on PGM3 and its role in human health, the following key references are recommended:
