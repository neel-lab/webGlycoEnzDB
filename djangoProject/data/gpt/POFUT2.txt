Write a 100-350 word essay about human POFUT2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human POFUT2 (Protein O-Fucosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme integral to the process of glycosylation, specifically in the O-fucosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). POFUT2 catalyzes the addition of fucose, a monosaccharide, to serine or threonine residues within TSRs. This post-translational modification is essential for the proper function of proteins containing TSRs, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), POFUT2 plays a crucial role in the folding and secretion of several proteins with TSRs. These proteins have significant roles in developmental processes and in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Notably, proper O-fucosylation by POFUT2 is necessary for the biological activity of these proteins, influencing their interactions with other molecules and their contribution to cell signaling pathways.

Dysfunction or mutations in POFUT2 have been linked to developmental disorders and diseases. A notable condition associated with POFUT2 dysfunction is Peters Plus syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye abnormalities, short stature, developmental delay, and other systemic manifestations. The involvement of POFUT2 in this syndrome highlights its importance in developmental processes and cellular signaling.

For more detailed information on POFUT2 and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
