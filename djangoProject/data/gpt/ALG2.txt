### Function
Human ALG2 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 2) is a critical enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, functioning as an alpha-1,3/1,6-mannosyltransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of the second and third mannose residues to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. ALG2's role is essential for constructing the core oligosaccharide structure required for proper protein glycosylation, impacting protein folding and stability.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG2 participates in a key step of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis. It transfers mannose from GDP-mannose to the GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol intermediate. Specifically, ALG2 adds an alpha-1,3-linked mannose to form Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, followed by an alpha-1,6-linked mannose to form Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. These sequential reactions are crucial for extending the oligosaccharide precursor, which is further elongated and modified before being transferred to nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the ER lumen.

### Location
ALG2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), embedded in the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. This strategic positioning allows ALG2 to efficiently access its substrates, GDP-mannose and the GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol intermediate, facilitating the mannosylation steps required for N-glycosylation. The ER is the primary site for the early stages of glycoprotein synthesis, where the initial assembly of the glycan structures takes place.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG2 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type I (ALG2-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG2-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and various organ dysfunctions. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions. Patients with ALG2-CDG often exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, underscoring the enzyme's importance in human health.

In summary, human ALG2 is a vital enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating key mannosylation steps necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER and its role in glycan assembly underscore its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG2 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting its critical role in human health.
