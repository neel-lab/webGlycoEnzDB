Write a 100-350 word essay about human B3GAT3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human B3GAT3 (Beta-1,3-Glucuronyltransferase 3) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically involved in the formation of the link region that connects GAG chains to their core proteins. This enzyme's function is vital for the proper assembly of proteoglycans, which are major components of the extracellular matrix and play a significant role in cell signaling, cell adhesion, and tissue development.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
B3GAT3 catalyzes the addition of glucuronic acid to the growing GAG chain, a critical step in the synthesis of proteoglycans like heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. These proteoglycans are essential for the structural integrity of various tissues and are involved in numerous biological processes, including cell proliferation, morphogenesis, and wound healing. The activity of B3GAT3 ensures the correct assembly and attachment of GAG chains to their respective core proteins, thereby influencing the biomechanical properties of tissues and cellular interactions.

Location:
B3GAT3 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where the elongation and modification of GAG chains occur. The Golgi apparatus is a key organelle in the post-translational modification and sorting of proteins, and its involvement in proteoglycan biosynthesis underscores the importance of B3GAT3 in this process.

Diseases:
Mutations in the B3GAT3 gene can lead to various connective tissue disorders. Notably, these include Larsen syndrome and multiple joint dislocations, both characterized by skeletal abnormalities, joint laxity, and in some cases, cardiovascular and ocular anomalies. These disorders reflect the critical role of B3GAT3 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of connective tissues.

Key References:
