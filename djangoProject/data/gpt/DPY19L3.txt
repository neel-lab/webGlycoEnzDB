Write a 100-350 word essay about human DPY19L3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human DPY19L3 is a member of the DPY19 gene family, which has been increasingly studied for its role in cellular processes, particularly in relation to cilia function and development. While DPY19L3 is less characterized compared to other members of this gene family, emerging research indicates its potential involvement in crucial cellular mechanisms.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
DPY19L3 is hypothesized to be involved in the regulation of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the cell surface that play critical roles in cell movement and signaling. Cilia are essential for various physiological processes, including sensory perception, cell motility, and embryonic development. DPY19L3 may participate in the transport or assembly of ciliary components or in the regulation of ciliary signaling pathways. These functions are vital for maintaining the structural integrity and proper function of cilia.

Location:
The exact subcellular localization of DPY19L3 is not fully established. However, based on its potential function in ciliary biology, it may be associated with ciliary structures or related organelles such as the basal body, which anchors and organizes the ciliary structure.

Diseases:
While direct links between DPY19L3 dysfunction and specific diseases have not been firmly established, disruptions in ciliary function are known to contribute to a group of disorders known as ciliopathies. These include conditions like polycystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, and certain developmental disorders. Future research into DPY19L3's role in cilia may reveal its potential implications in these and other ciliopathy-related diseases.

Key References:
For more detailed information on DPY19L3, consider the following references:

1. **"The Emerging Complexity of the Vertebrate Cilium: New Functional Roles for an Ancient Organelle" by Ishikawa and Marshall in Developmental Cell (2011).
