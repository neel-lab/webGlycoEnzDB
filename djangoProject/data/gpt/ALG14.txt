### Function
Human ALG14 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 14) is an essential glycosyltransferase involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. ALG14 functions as a regulatory subunit, interacting with ALG13 to form a functional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) transferase complex. This complex is responsible for the addition of the second N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, which is crucial for the proper glycosylation of proteins.

### Reaction Pathways
The reaction pathway involving ALG14 includes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-PP-dolichol, facilitated by the ALG13/ALG14 complex. This step is critical for forming GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, a precursor necessary for the elongation and maturation of the glycan structure. The formation of the GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is a key step in the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide that is transferred to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferase.

### Location
ALG14 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors it to the ER membrane, positioning it optimally to interact with its partner ALG13 and other glycosylation machinery. The ER localization of ALG14 is essential for its function, as it ensures the enzyme complex can access its substrates and participate efficiently in the glycosylation pathway.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG14 gene have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG14-CDG can include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and various organ dysfunctions. Although specific cases of ALG14-related CDG are less documented compared to other CDG types, the enzyme's role in essential glycosylation processes underscores its potential impact on human health when mutated  .

In summary, human ALG14 is a critical component of the N-glycosylation pathway, functioning as part of a complex that adds crucial sugar residues to glycoproteins. Its ER localization is essential for its activity, and mutations in ALG14 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting its importance in proper protein glycosylation and overall cellular function.
