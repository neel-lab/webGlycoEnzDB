Human ALG14 (Asparagine-linked glycosylation 14) is a key enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, crucial for protein folding and function. As part of a glycosyltransferase complex, ALG14 works in tandem with ALG13 to catalyze the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to GlcNAc-PP-Dol, producing GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. This step is essential in the early stages of lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane​​​​.

ALG14 is an integral membrane protein of the ER, and its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) is crucial for its interaction with other glycosyltransferases, particularly ALG13. This interaction is necessary for the formation of a hetero-oligomeric glycosyltransferase complex, which includes ALG7, the GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase catalyzing the first step of the LLO pathway. ALG14 acts as a core coordinator in the recruitment of these catalytic partners to initiate N-glycosylation​​.

The enzymatic activity of ALG14 is crucial for the proper functioning of the UDP-GlcNAc transferase complex. The soluble, cytosolic form of ALG13, which possesses the catalytic domain of the transferase, requires binding to ALG14 at the ER membrane to become active. This hetero-oligomeric formation between ALG13 and ALG14 is vital for the effective catalysis of the UDP-GlcNAc transferase reaction​​.

While specific human diseases directly linked to ALG14 mutations have not been reported, disruptions in the function of ALG14 can potentially lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), given its essential role in the glycosylation pathway. CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that result from defects in the glycosylation process and can manifest in various clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and multisystemic problems.

For more detailed information on human ALG14, the following references are recommended:
