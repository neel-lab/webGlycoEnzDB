### Function
Human PIGO, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class O, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are important glycolipid structures that tether proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response. PIGO is specifically responsible for transferring ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose in the GPI precursor, a crucial step for the proper assembly and maturation of the GPI anchor.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGO operates within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After the addition of mannose residues to the GPI precursor, PIGO catalyzes the transfer of ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose. This step is essential for forming a functional GPI anchor that can be effectively attached to proteins. The successful modification of the GPI precursor by PIGO ensures that the GPI anchor can perform its role in securing proteins to the cell membrane, allowing them to carry out their biological functions.

### Location
PIGO is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it carries out its enzymatic function in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. The ER serves as the site for the initial stages of protein synthesis and modification, providing the ideal environment for PIGO to interact with other enzymes involved in GPI anchor assembly. This localization is critical for the proper processing and attachment of GPI-anchored proteins to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGO gene are linked to inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), specifically conditions like multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 2 (MCAHS2). This rare genetic disorder is characterized by a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and congenital anomalies. These symptoms arise due to defective GPI anchor biosynthesis, which leads to the improper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins. Understanding the role of PIGO in GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for diagnosing and developing potential treatments for these conditions.
