Write a 100-350 word essay about human SULF1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SULF1 (Sulfatase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are components of the extracellular matrix and cell surface. SULF1 selectively removes sulfate groups from specific glucosamine residues within heparan sulfate chains. This desulfation process is essential for regulating various biological activities mediated by HSPGs, including cell signaling, cell-matrix interactions, and growth factor binding.

Located in the cell membrane and extracellular matrix, SULF1 functions mainly in modulating the interaction between HSPGs and a variety of signaling molecules, particularly those involved in growth factor pathways such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Wnt. By altering the sulfation pattern of heparan sulfate chains, SULF1 regulates the availability and activity of these growth factors, impacting processes like angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and tissue repair.

SULF1 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. Altered expression of SULF1 can affect tumor growth and metastasis. In certain cancers, downregulation of SULF1 has been observed, which may enhance growth factor signaling and promote tumor progression. Conversely, overexpression of SULF1 in some tumor types can suppress growth factor-mediated signaling pathways, inhibiting tumor growth and angiogenesis.

For more detailed information on SULF1, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
