Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human SGSH. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human SGSH, or N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a complex carbohydrate involved in various biological processes, including cell signaling, growth, and development. SGSH specifically catalyzes the removal of sulfate groups from the N-sulfoglucosamine residues in heparan sulfate, a key step in breaking down this glycosaminoglycan (GAG) within lysosomes.

### Reaction Pathways
SGSH functions within the lysosomal degradation pathway, where it is involved in the stepwise breakdown of heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate is a major component of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces, and its degradation is essential for recycling cellular materials and maintaining cellular function. SGSH removes sulfate groups from N-sulfoglucosamine residues in heparan sulfate, which is necessary for the subsequent enzymatic steps that fully degrade the GAG into smaller molecules that the cell can reuse or dispose of.

### Location
SGSH is localized in the lysosomes, which are specialized organelles responsible for degrading and recycling various biomolecules. The lysosomal environment provides the acidic conditions necessary for SGSH to function optimally. Within the lysosomes, SGSH works in concert with other enzymes to ensure the complete degradation of heparan sulfate, preventing its accumulation within cells.

### Diseases
Mutations in the SGSH gene lead to a lysosomal storage disorder known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A, or Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA). This condition is characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate in cells due to the enzyme's inability to degrade it properly. The buildup of heparan sulfate leads to severe neurological symptoms, including progressive cognitive decline, behavioral problems, and physical deterioration. Sanfilippo syndrome is a devastating disorder with no cure, and understanding SGSHâ€™s function is crucial for developing potential therapies to treat or manage the disease.
