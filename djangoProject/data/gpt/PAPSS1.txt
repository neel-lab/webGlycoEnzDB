Write a 100-350 word essay about human PAPSS1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PAPSS1 (3'-Phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate Synthase 1) is an enzyme crucial for sulfate conjugation, a key biochemical pathway involved in the synthesis of sulfated compounds, including glycosaminoglycans, steroids, and certain hormones. PAPSS1 catalyzes the biosynthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor in sulfation reactions. This synthesis involves the adenylation of ATP and the subsequent transfer of a sulfate group from inorganic sulfate to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).

PAPSS1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cellular sulfation processes. Sulfation is essential for various biological activities, including detoxification, hormone regulation, and the modification of extracellular matrix components like proteoglycans.

Dysfunction or deficiency in PAPSS1 can lead to disorders related to impaired sulfation. One notable condition is a form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Patients with PAPSS1 deficiency exhibit defective cartilage and bone development due to insufficient sulfation of proteoglycans, which are critical for the structure and function of these tissues.

For more detailed information on PAPSS1 and its role in human health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
