Write a 100-350 word essay about human HS3ST1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human HS3ST1 (heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 1) is an enzyme crucial in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a significant glycosaminoglycan found on cell surfaces and within extracellular matrices. HS3ST1 specifically catalyzes the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate. This sulfation process is essential for determining the structure and function of HS, thereby influencing various biological activities including cell signaling, blood coagulation, and viral entry into cells.

HS3ST1 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the post-translational modification of HS chains attached to core proteins, forming heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). These HSPGs are involved in numerous physiological processes such as developmental signaling, angiogenesis, and neural development.

The specific 3-O-sulfation by HS3ST1 plays a critical role in modulating the interaction of HS with a range of proteins, including growth factors, chemokines, and antithrombin. For example, the sulfation pattern introduced by HS3ST1 is crucial for the binding of HS to antithrombin, which regulates blood coagulation and thrombosis.

Alterations in the function of HS3ST1 can have significant implications for human health. For instance, dysregulation of HS3ST1 has been associated with various pathologies, including cancer progression and blood coagulation disorders. Its role in tumor progression and metastasis is particularly notable, as changes in HS structure can affect tumor cell behavior and interaction with the tumor microenvironment.
