### Function
Human HS3ST1, or heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 1, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the modification of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan that is integral to cell surface interactions and the extracellular matrix. HS3ST1 specifically catalyzes the transfer of a sulfate group to the 3-O position of glucosamine residues within the heparan sulfate chains. This sulfation event is key to creating specific binding sites on heparan sulfate that interact with various proteins, including antithrombin and growth factors, thereby regulating processes such as blood coagulation, cell signaling, and viral entry.

### Reaction Pathways
HS3ST1 operates within the heparan sulfate biosynthesis pathway. After the heparan sulfate chains are polymerized and undergo initial modifications, HS3ST1 adds a sulfate group to the 3-O position of glucosamine residues, a modification that is crucial for the biological activity of heparan sulfate. This 3-O-sulfation is particularly important in the regulation of blood coagulation, as it enhances the binding affinity of heparan sulfate for antithrombin, a key inhibitor of blood clotting. Additionally, this modification can influence the interaction of heparan sulfate with growth factors and cytokines, impacting cell growth and immune responses.

### Location
HS3ST1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as part of the machinery that modifies heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for processing and modifying proteins and lipids before they are transported to their final destinations. In this location, HS3ST1 ensures that heparan sulfate chains are properly sulfated, allowing them to participate in critical cellular processes.

### Diseases
Dysregulation of HS3ST1 has been associated with several diseases, including cancer and viral infections. In cancer, abnormal expression of HS3ST1 can alter the structure of heparan sulfate, affecting tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In the context of viral infections, certain viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, exploit the 3-O-sulfated sites on heparan sulfate for entry into host cells, making HS3ST1 a potential target for antiviral therapies. Understanding the role of HS3ST1 in these diseases is important for developing treatments that can modulate heparan sulfate's interactions with various proteins.
