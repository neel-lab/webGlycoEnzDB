Write a 100-350 word essay about human POMK : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human POMK (Protein O-Mannose Kinase) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the post-translational modification of dystroglycan, a key protein in muscle and neural cells. POMK is involved in the phosphorylation of O-mannose glycans on alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG), a crucial step in the maturation and functional expression of α-DG.

POMK is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the addition of a phosphate group to the mannose residue in O-mannose-linked glycans. This phosphorylation is essential for the subsequent addition of other sugar residues to α-DG, which is necessary for its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins like laminin. These interactions are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers and proper neural development.

Mutations in the POMK gene have been linked to a group of rare genetic disorders known as dystroglycanopathies, characterized by a range of symptoms including muscular dystrophy, intellectual disabilities, and abnormalities in brain development. One such disorder associated with POMK mutations is Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS), a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy that also involves brain and eye abnormalities.

For more information on POMK and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:

These references provide insights into the biochemical role of POMK, its importance in the modification of dystroglycan, and the implications of its dysfunction in dystroglycanopathies such as Walker-Warburg Syndrome.
