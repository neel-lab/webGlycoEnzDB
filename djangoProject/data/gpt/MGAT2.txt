Write a 100-350 word essay about human MGAT2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.



Human MGAT2 (Mannosyl (Alpha-1,6-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2) is an essential enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a critical process for the proper folding and function of many glycoproteins. MGAT2 specifically catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues in the oligosaccharide chains attached to nascent glycoproteins. This action is vital in the formation of complex and hybrid N-glycans, which are important for the stability, activity, and cellular localization of various proteins.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MGAT2â€™s role in glycoprotein maturation is critical. By adding GlcNAc to the growing glycan chains on glycoproteins, MGAT2 influences the final structure and functionality of these proteins, which are integral to a wide array of cellular processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, and protein trafficking.

Deficiency in MGAT2 function leads to a form of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG-IIa. This rare inherited metabolic disorder is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and gastrointestinal problems. The diversity of symptoms reflects the importance of N-glycosylation in numerous biological systems.

For more detailed information on MGAT2 and its role in glycoprotein processing, the following key references are recommended:
