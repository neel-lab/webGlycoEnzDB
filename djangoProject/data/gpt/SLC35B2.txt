Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35B2 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35B2, also known as the UDP-galactose transporter, is an essential component of the cellular glycosylation machinery. This transporter plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance and supply of UDP-galactose within the Golgi apparatus, where it is utilized for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids.

SLC35B2 is located in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus and is responsible for transporting UDP-galactose from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen. Inside the Golgi, UDP-galactose is used as a substrate by various galactosyltransferases to add galactose to glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. This process of glycosylation is critical for the proper function, stability, and localization of these molecules, influencing a wide range of biological activities, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein quality control.

Disruptions or mutations in the SLC35B2 gene can lead to abnormalities in glycosylation processes, potentially affecting multiple biological systems. While specific diseases directly attributed to SLC35B2 mutations are not extensively documented, general dysfunctions in glycosylation pathways are known to contribute to a range of disorders, including congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). These are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, leading to diverse symptoms, depending on the type and severity of the glycosylation defect.

For more detailed information on SLC35B2, its function, and its role in glycosylation, the following key references are recommended:
