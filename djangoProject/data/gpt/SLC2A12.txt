### Function
Human SLC2A12, also known as GLUT12, is a glucose transporter that facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells. GLUT12 is part of the larger family of facilitative glucose transporters, which mediate the movement of glucose across cell membranes without the use of ATP. GLUT12 is thought to play a role in glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, contributing to the regulation of glucose homeostasis in the body.

### Reaction Pathways
GLUT12 functions in the glucose transport pathway, where it mediates the facilitative diffusion of glucose from the extracellular space into cells. This process is crucial for providing cells with the glucose necessary for energy production through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. GLUT12â€™s activity may be regulated by insulin, similar to other glucose transporters like GLUT4, particularly in tissues involved in metabolic regulation and energy storage.

### Location
SLC2A12 is primarily expressed in insulin-responsive tissues, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the heart. It is also found in other tissues such as the small intestine and prostate. The localization of GLUT12 in these tissues suggests a role in maintaining glucose uptake in response to insulin, helping to regulate blood sugar levels and ensure an adequate supply of glucose for energy-intensive activities, such as muscle contraction and cardiac function.

### Diseases
While GLUT12 has not been as extensively studied as other glucose transporters, its role in glucose uptake suggests it could be implicated in metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Abnormal expression or function of GLUT12 may contribute to impaired glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and metabolic dysregulation. Understanding the function of SLC2A12 is important for elucidating its potential role in metabolic diseases and developing therapeutic strategies for conditions like diabetes.
