Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGB: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human PIGB (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class B) is an enzyme integral to the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, complex molecules that attach proteins to cell membranes. PIGB catalyzes the addition of ethanolamine phosphate to the first mannose in the GPI anchor precursor, a critical step in GPI biosynthesis.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGB's role is pivotal in the assembly and maturation of GPI anchors. These anchors are essential for the attachment and proper function of various proteins on the cell surface, including enzymes, adhesion molecules, and receptors. GPI-anchored proteins are involved in numerous biological processes, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

Dysfunction in PIGB and other enzymes of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway can lead to GPI anchor deficiencies. These deficiencies are associated with a group of rare genetic disorders collectively known as GPI anchor deficiencies or GPIBDs. Patients with GPIBDs can present a variety of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and congenital malformations. The specific phenotype can vary depending on the affected enzyme in the GPI biosynthesis pathway.

For more detailed information on PIGB, its function, and associated diseases, the following key references are recommended:
