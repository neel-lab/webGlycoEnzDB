Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human PIGB. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human PIGB, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class B, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that attach certain proteins to the cell membrane, enabling them to participate in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGB is specifically responsible for adding the third mannose molecule to the growing GPI anchor structure, a crucial step in the proper assembly of the anchor.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGB functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway involves multiple enzymatic steps, where PIGB catalyzes the addition of a mannose residue to the GPI precursor, following the actions of other enzymes that add the first two mannose residues. This mannose addition by PIGB is essential for the continued elongation and maturation of the GPI anchor, ultimately allowing the anchor to properly attach proteins to the cell membrane.

### Location
PIGB is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where GPI anchor biosynthesis occurs. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGB to carry out its function, ensuring that GPI anchors are correctly assembled before being transported to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and eventually to the cell surface. The precise localization of PIGB within the ER is crucial for its role in the GPI biosynthesis pathway.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGB gene can lead to defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, which may result in a group of disorders known as inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs). These disorders are characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, developmental delays, and dysmorphic features. The dysfunction in PIGB leads to incomplete or improperly formed GPI anchors, causing a failure in the proper localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins. Understanding the role of PIGB in GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for diagnosing and developing treatments for these conditions.
