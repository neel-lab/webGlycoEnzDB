Human ALG10B (ALG10B, Alpha-1,2-Glucosyltransferase B) is a relatively recently identified enzyme and part of the larger family involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a vital cellular process for the proper folding and maturation of many proteins. While specific details about the exact function of ALG10B are still emerging, its association with the glycosylation pathway suggests its significant role in cellular biology.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG10B is thought to participate in the process of N-linked glycosylation, particularly in the addition of glucose residues to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor. This step is essential in the assembly of the LLO, which is subsequently transferred to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The role of ALG10B in this process is critical, as it helps ensure proper protein folding and quality control, thereby impacting the stability and function of glycosylated proteins.

Location:
Like other enzymes involved in N-linked glycosylation, ALG10B is likely located in the ER, where the synthesis and processing of N-linked glycans occur. This subcellary localization is central to the protein synthesis and maturation process, making ALG10Bâ€™s activity crucial in these cellular pathways.

Diseases:
Given its role in glycosylation, mutations or dysfunctions in ALG10B could potentially lead to types of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the process of glycosylation, leading to a wide range of clinical symptoms that can include developmental delay, neurological issues, and metabolic abnormalities. The severity of these symptoms reflects the essential nature of glycosylation in numerous cellular functions.
