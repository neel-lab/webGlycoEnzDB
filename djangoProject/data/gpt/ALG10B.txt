### Function
Human ALG10B (asparagine-linked glycosylation 10B) is a glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the later stages of N-linked glycosylation. Specifically, ALG10B is responsible for the addition of the third glucose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, forming Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. This fully glucosylated structure is essential for proper protein folding and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ensuring that glycoproteins are correctly assembled before they are transported to their final destinations.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG10B catalyzes the transfer of glucose from dolichyl-phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) to the growing oligosaccharide chain. The enzyme facilitates the addition of the third glucose molecule, completing the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure. This step is crucial as the fully glucosylated glycan is recognized by ER chaperone proteins such as calnexin and calreticulin, which assist in proper protein folding and prevent misfolded proteins from accumulating. This quality control mechanism is vital for maintaining cellular function and preventing diseases related to protein misfolding.

### Location
ALG10B is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is integrated into the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the lumen. The ER is the primary site for the initial stages of protein glycosylation, where enzymes like ALG10B ensure that glycoproteins acquire the necessary modifications for correct folding and functionality. By being situated in the ER, ALG10B can efficiently interact with its substrates and other glycosylation machinery to complete the synthesis of the oligosaccharide precursor.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG10B gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type II (ALG10B-CDG). These disorders arise from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly folded glycoproteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG10B-CDG can include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and various organ dysfunctions. The severity and range of symptoms can vary, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions  .

In summary, human ALG10B is an essential enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating the final glucose addition necessary for proper protein folding and quality control. Its localization in the ER underscores its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG10B can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in human health.
