Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC2A8: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC2A8, commonly known as GLUT8, is a member of the GLUT family of facilitative glucose transporters with distinct functional characteristics and tissue-specific expression. GLUT8 is known for its role in glucose transport, but it also shows a unique intracellular distribution and regulation compared to other GLUT family members.

Primarily localized in intracellular compartments, particularly in endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, GLUT8 is involved in intracellular glucose transport. It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, testes, and adipose tissue, indicating its potential role in the metabolic activities of these organs. In the brain, GLUT8 is thought to contribute to neuronal glucose metabolism, which is essential for proper cognitive function and neural activity.

In the testes, GLUT8 is believed to play a role in spermatogenesis, possibly by providing energy for developing sperm cells. Its presence in adipose tissue suggests a role in lipid metabolism, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

The exact physiological function of GLUT8 and its contribution to systemic glucose homeostasis is still under investigation. However, alterations in GLUT8 expression or function have been implicated in metabolic disorders. Dysregulation of GLUT8 might contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, obesity, and other related metabolic conditions.

For more information on SLC2A8/GLUT8, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
