### Function
Human GMDS, or GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, a key sugar nucleotide involved in fucosylation. GMDS catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, which is a crucial step in the synthesis of GDP-fucose. Fucosylation is a type of glycosylation that adds fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids, impacting processes such as cell signaling, immune responses, and protein stability.

### Reaction Pathways
GMDS functions within the fucose biosynthesis pathway, specifically in the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. This pathway begins with GMDS catalyzing the dehydration of GDP-mannose to produce GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. This intermediate is then further reduced to form GDP-fucose by the enzyme GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (FX). The GDP-fucose produced is then used in various fucosylation reactions that modify glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing their biological functions and interactions.

### Location
GMDS is localized in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the nucleotide sugar biosynthesis pathways. The cytoplasmic localization allows GMDS to access GDP-mannose and efficiently produce GDP-fucose, which is then transported to the Golgi apparatus for incorporation into glycoproteins and glycolipids during glycosylation. The enzyme’s activity in the cytoplasm is essential for maintaining the supply of GDP-fucose needed for proper cellular glycosylation.

### Diseases
Mutations or deficiencies in GMDS can lead to disorders related to abnormal fucosylation. Impaired GMDS function disrupts the production of GDP-fucose, leading to defective fucosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This can result in a variety of clinical manifestations, including developmental abnormalities, immune deficiencies, and neurological issues. While specific genetic disorders directly caused by GMDS mutations are rare, altered fucosylation due to GMDS dysfunction has been observed in certain cancers, where it can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis by affecting cell adhesion and immune evasion. Understanding GMDS’s role in these processes highlights its importance in both normal physiology and disease.
