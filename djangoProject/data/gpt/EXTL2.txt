Human EXTL2 (Exostosin-Like Glycosyltransferase 2) is an important enzyme in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. EXTL2 specifically contributes to the polymerization and modification of heparan sulfate chains, a function essential for proper cell signaling, development, and homeostasis.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
EXTL2's main function is to catalyze the addition of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine to the growing heparan sulfate chain. This activity is critical for forming the long, linear heparan sulfate chains that are then further modified by other enzymes. These modifications are essential as they determine the binding capacity of heparan sulfate to various growth factors, morphogens, and other signaling molecules. The precise structure of heparan sulfate chains influences many biological processes, including cell signaling pathways, morphogenesis, and cell migration.

Location:
EXTL2 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular organelle where glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate are synthesized and elongated. This strategic positioning allows EXTL2 to efficiently contribute to the polymerization process of heparan sulfate chains as they are assembled on proteoglycan core proteins.

Diseases:
While direct links between EXTL2 dysfunction and specific human diseases are not well-established, aberrations in heparan sulfate biosynthesis can contribute to various pathological conditions. Defects in heparan sulfate structure and function can disrupt normal cell signaling and tissue development, potentially leading to developmental disorders or contributing to the progression of certain cancers. Additionally, since heparan sulfate is involved in cell adhesion and migration, abnormalities in its biosynthesis could impact wound healing and tissue regeneration.

Key References:
For more detailed information on EXTL2, consider the following key references:
