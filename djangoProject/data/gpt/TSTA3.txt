Write a 100-350 word essay about human TSTA3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human TSTA3 (Tissue Specific Transplantation Antigen P35B) is an enzyme crucial in the biochemical pathway of GDP-L-fucose synthesis, which plays a vital role in glycosylation. TSTA3 catalyzes the conversion of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose to GDP-L-fucose, an essential donor substrate for fucosylation in the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Located in the cytosol, TSTA3 is a key player in the fucose salvage pathway, which recycles fucose from degraded glycoconjugates for the resynthesis of GDP-L-fucose. Fucosylation, the process of adding fucose residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids, is critical for various biological functions, including cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response. Fucosylated structures are involved in a number of physiological processes, such as inflammation, tumor metastasis, and pathogen recognition.

Dysfunction or mutations in the TSTA3 gene can lead to disorders in fucosylation, impacting numerous physiological processes. Abnormal fucosylation patterns have been linked to certain diseases, including congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), which are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation pathways. These disorders can manifest a wide range of symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and organ dysfunction.

The study of TSTA3 and its involvement in disease is an area of growing interest. For more detailed information on TSTA3, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
