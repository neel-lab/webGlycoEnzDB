Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT1A8: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT1A8 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 1 Member A8) is a vital enzyme in the body's detoxification process. Part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, UGT1A8 plays a key role in the glucuronidation pathway, a crucial phase II biotransformation mechanism. This pathway involves the conjugation of glucuronic acid to various substrates, including dietary carcinogens, environmental toxins, drugs, and endogenous compounds, thereby enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion.

UGT1A8 is predominantly expressed in extrahepatic tissues, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon and small intestine. Its primary function in these locations is to assist in detoxifying a wide range of substances, particularly those ingested through diet. By converting these compounds into more water-soluble forms, UGT1A8 contributes significantly to the body's defense against potentially harmful chemicals.

The enzyme's role in drug metabolism is also significant. Variability in UGT1A8 activity, due to genetic polymorphisms, can influence the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of various medications, affecting their efficacy and safety. For example, individuals with certain UGT1A8 variants may have altered responses to drugs metabolized by this enzyme, impacting their therapeutic effectiveness and risk of adverse reactions.

Abnormalities in UGT1A8 function or expression have been linked to several health issues. For instance, reduced UGT1A8 activity can contribute to an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers, as it may lead to inadequate detoxification of carcinogens present in food. Additionally, its role in the metabolism of endogenous substances implicates UGT1A8 in various metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders.

For more detailed information on UGT1A8, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
