### Function
Human GALNT3, or polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3, is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the O-linked glycosylation process. Specifically, GALNT3 catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to the serine or threonine residues on target proteins, forming the initial GalNAc-Ser/Thr linkage. This modification is critical in the biosynthesis of mucin-type O-glycans, which are involved in various biological processes such as protein stability, signaling, and protection against proteolysis.

### Reaction Pathways
GALNT3 is involved in the initiation of the O-glycosylation pathway, particularly in the synthesis of O-GalNAc glycans. The enzyme transfers GalNAc to serine or threonine residues in specific protein substrates, creating a core structure that can be further elongated and modified by other glycosyltransferases. This enzymatic action is essential for the formation of functional glycoproteins that play roles in extracellular matrix formation, immune response, and cell communication.

### Location
GALNT3 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular organelle responsible for post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. Within the Golgi, GALNT3 ensures that proteins undergo proper glycosylation before being transported to their final destinations. This localization is crucial for the enzyme to access its substrates and participate in the sequential steps of glycan biosynthesis.

### Diseases
Mutations in the GALNT3 gene are associated with familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC), a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal calcium phosphate deposition in soft tissues. This condition results from the disruption of normal phosphate metabolism, leading to excessive calcification. GALNT3 mutations impair the enzyme's function in modifying proteins involved in phosphate regulation, such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Without proper glycosylation by GALNT3, FGF23 is degraded more rapidly, leading to elevated phosphate levels in the blood and subsequent calcification. Additionally, GALNT3 dysregulation has been observed in some cancers, suggesting a broader role in disease through its influence on glycoprotein function and cell signaling.
