Human GCNT3, also known as Core 2/I-branching enzyme or Beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3, is an enzyme integral to the process of glycan biosynthesis.

Function
GCNT3 is responsible for adding N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to O-glycans, specifically in a beta-1,6 linkage. This enzymatic action is essential for the formation of core 2 O-glycans, which are complex carbohydrate structures critical for various cellular functions. Core 2 O-glycans are involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response, and the activity of GCNT3 thus influences the glycosylation pattern of proteins and affects their function and localization.

Reaction Pathways
GCNT3 plays a role in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, particularly in the elaboration of branched O-glycans. Its specific function involves the addition of GlcNAc to O-glycans, leading to the formation of more complex glycan structures. These structures, found on many cell surface proteins, are involved in numerous biological processes.

Location
GCNT3 is a type 2 transmembrane protein and, like many glycosyltransferases, is localized in the Golgi apparatus. The enzyme’s structure, including a C-terminal catalytic domain, a stem region, a transmembrane domain, and a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, suggests its localization in the cis-medial Golgi, where it participates in glycosylation processes​​.

Related Diseases
Specific diseases directly associated with GCNT3 dysfunction are not detailed in the cited material. However, given its role in glycan biosynthesis, alterations in GCNT3 activity could potentially lead to disorders affecting cellular communication, immune responses, and cell adhesion, potentially contributing to various pathologies.
