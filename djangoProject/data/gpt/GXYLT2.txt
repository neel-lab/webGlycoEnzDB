Write a 100-350 word essay about human GXYLT2 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human GXYLT2, or Glucoside Xylosyltransferase 2, is an enzyme involved in the modification of specific proteins through glycosylation.

Function
GXYLT2 is one of the three xylosyltransferases (including GXYLT1 and XXYLT1) that add xylose to the EGF repeats of Notch and other proteins. The addition of xylose residues by GXYLT2 forms part of a trisaccharide, Xyl-Xyl-Glc, which is important for the function of these proteins. Notch signaling, a crucial pathway in cell development and communication, is one of the key processes affected by this modification.

Reaction Pathways
GXYLT2 participates in the glycosylation of proteins, specifically in the addition of xylose residues. This process is vital for the proper functioning of Notch signaling pathways. The enzyme uses UDP-xylose as a substrate to add xylose to EGF repeats on Notch and other proteins, impacting their structure and interaction capabilities.

Location
The specific cellular localization of human GXYLT2 is not detailed in my knowledge source. However, given its role in protein modification, GXYLT2 is likely localized in the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where glycosylation processes typically occur.

Related Diseases
Disruptions in the function of GXYLT2 and the consequent alterations in the glycosylation of Notch can potentially lead to various developmental disorders and diseases. Abnormal Notch signaling has been implicated in numerous conditions, including congenital diseases and cancer.
