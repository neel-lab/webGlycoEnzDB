### Function
Human ST6GALNAC6, or ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 6, is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues on glycoproteins. This enzyme plays a crucial role in forming sialyl-T and sialyl-Tn antigens, structures that are essential for various biological processes, including cell-cell interactions, immune responses, and the stability of glycoproteins.

### Reaction Pathways
ST6GALNAC6 functions within the glycosylation pathway, where it facilitates the sialylation of O-linked glycans on glycoproteins. Specifically, it transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid, a donor molecule, to GalNAc residues, creating sialylated structures. These structures are involved in numerous cellular processes, such as modulating immune cell activity, cell signaling, and maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes. The enzyme's activity is particularly important in tissues where these processes are critical for normal function and development.

### Location
ST6GALNAC6 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of proteins. The Golgi is the central hub for processing and sorting proteins, and the presence of ST6GALNAC6 ensures that glycoproteins are properly sialylated before they are transported to their final destinations, such as the cell surface or extracellular space. This localization is essential for the enzyme's role in producing functional glycoproteins.

### Diseases
Altered expression or activity of ST6GALNAC6 has been associated with various diseases, particularly cancer. In certain cancers, such as breast and colon cancer, the overexpression of ST6GALNAC6 leads to increased sialylation of glycoproteins, which can promote tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to immune detection. These sialylated antigens are often markers of aggressive tumor phenotypes. Understanding the role of ST6GALNAC6 in these processes is important for developing targeted therapies aimed at modulating sialylation patterns in cancer and other diseases where glycosylation plays a critical role.
