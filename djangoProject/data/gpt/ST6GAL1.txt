Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST6GAL1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST6GAL1 (ST6 beta-galactosamide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1) is an enzyme crucial in the glycosylation process, particularly in the sialylation of N-linked glycoproteins. ST6GAL1 is responsible for adding sialic acid to the terminal galactose of N-glycans in an alpha-2,6 linkage, a modification that plays a key role in various cellular functions.

Located predominantly in the Golgi apparatus, ST6GAL1 modifies glycoproteins that are integral to cell signaling, immune responses, and protein stability. This enzyme's activity is vital in determining the structure and function of sialylated glycoproteins, which are involved in cell-cell interactions, adhesion, and recognition processes.

The expression and activity of ST6GAL1 are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts. For example, altered sialylation patterns mediated by ST6GAL1 have been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. In tumor cells, changes in glycosylation, including increased sialylation, can affect cell behavior, promoting invasiveness, metastatic potential, and evasion from the immune system. Additionally, ST6GAL1 is involved in immune regulation, where its action on glycoproteins can influence immune cell signaling and responses.

While direct links between specific diseases and ST6GAL1 mutations are not extensively established, the enzyme's role in critical glycosylation processes suggests potential involvement in various disorders, particularly those related to immune function and cancer.

For more detailed information on ST6GAL1, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
