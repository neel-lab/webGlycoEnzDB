Write a 100-350 word essay about human CHSY1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human CHSY1, abbreviated for Chondroitin Synthase 1, is an enzyme with a crucial role in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS), a key component of the extracellular matrix. CHSY1 exhibits glucuronyltransferase II (GlcAT-II) and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II (GalNAcT-II) activities, essential for synthesizing repeating disaccharide units of CS. However, it requires cooperation with other enzymes, such as CHPF, to achieve full polymerization of chondroitin in vivo.

CHSY1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression observed in the placenta, spleen, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Its broad distribution suggests a significant role in multiple physiological processes, including the development and maintenance of connective tissues.

Mutations in the CHSY1 gene have been linked to specific human diseases. Notably, alterations in CHSY1 are associated with Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome, a disorder characterized by limb malformations. This connection highlights the importance of CHSY1 in skeletal development and the maintenance of structural integrity in connective tissues.

In addition, recent studies have found an association between altered expression levels of chondroitin-synthesizing enzymes, including CHSY1, and colorectal cancer. This suggests that CHSY1 and related enzymes may play a role in cancer progression, possibly due to their impact on the extracellular matrix and cell signaling pathways.

For more detailed information on human CHSY1, the following key references are recommended:

Kitagawa et al. (2003): Provides insights into the enzymatic function and gene structure of CHSY1.
Hwang et al. (2003), Mizuguchi et al. (2003): Discuss the novel function of chondroitin in embryonic cytokinesis and cell division.
Li et al. (2010), Tian et al. (2010): Explore the association of CHSY1 mutations with Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome and its implication in colorectal cancer.
Understanding the role of CHSY1 in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis is crucial for advancing knowledge in connective tissue pathology, developmental biology, and potential therapeutic interventions for related disorders​​​​.
