Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human STT3B. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human STT3B is a crucial enzyme that functions as a catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is responsible for the N-glycosylation of proteins. Unlike its homolog STT3A, which primarily catalyzes co-translational glycosylation, STT3B is involved in post-translational glycosylation, adding glycans to sites that were missed during protein synthesis. This enzyme ensures the complete glycosylation of proteins, which is essential for their proper folding, stability, and function.

### Reaction Pathways
STT3B operates in the N-glycosylation pathway, where it transfers a pre-assembled oligosaccharide from a lipid-linked donor molecule, dolichol phosphate, to asparagine residues within specific consensus sequences (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) on nascent or newly synthesized polypeptides. While STT3A acts during protein translation, STT3B corrects glycosylation sites that were missed, adding glycans to proteins post-translationally. This activity is crucial for ensuring that all glycosylation sites are modified, which is vital for the proper function and quality control of glycoproteins.

### Location
STT3B is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is part of the OST complex embedded in the ER membrane. The ER is the site of protein synthesis and processing, including glycosylation. STT3Bâ€™s localization within the ER allows it to access and modify newly synthesized proteins, ensuring that they are fully glycosylated before being transported to their final destinations within the cell.

### Diseases
Mutations in the STT3B gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG-I, a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in protein glycosylation. These disorders can result in a variety of symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological impairments, immune deficiencies, and digestive issues. The severity and range of symptoms can vary depending on the specific mutation in the STT3B gene. Understanding the role of STT3B in the glycosylation process is important for diagnosing and treating these complex disorders.
