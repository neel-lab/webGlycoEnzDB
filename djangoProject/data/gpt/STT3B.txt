Write a 100-350 word essay about human STT3B: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human STT3B (STT3, subunit B of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex) is a critical component of the N-linked glycosylation process in eukaryotic cells. It is part of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which catalyzes the transfer of an oligosaccharide moiety from a lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor to specific asparagine residues in nascent polypeptide chains. 

Located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), STT3B primarily facilitates the post-translational addition of glycans to asparagine residues within the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline). This action is vital for proper protein folding, stability, and function. Unlike its paralog, STT3A, which is involved in the co-translational glycosylation of nascent polypeptides, STT3B is more involved in the post-translational glycosylation of skipped glycosylation sites and also handles a subset of glycoproteins.

The proper functioning of STT3B is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysfunctions or mutations in the STT3B gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation. These disorders can manifest a wide range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and multi-systemic abnormalities, reflecting the essential role of N-linked glycosylation in numerous biological processes.
