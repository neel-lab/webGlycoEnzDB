### Function
Human ALG8 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 8) is a glycosyltransferase enzyme essential in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. It functions specifically as a dolichyl-P-glucose:Glc1Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase, catalyzing the addition of the second glucose residue to the growing oligosaccharide precursor. This step is critical for the proper assembly and maturation of glycoproteins, affecting their folding and stability.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG8 catalyzes the transfer of glucose from dolichyl-phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) to the oligosaccharide intermediate Glc1Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This enzymatic activity results in the formation of Glc2Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This step is part of the glucosylation process that follows the initial glucose addition by ALG6 and precedes the final addition by ALG10. The resulting fully glucosylated oligosaccharide is essential for proper glycoprotein folding and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

### Location
ALG8 is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) membrane. It integrates into the ER membrane, with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. This strategic positioning allows ALG8 to efficiently access its substrates, Dol-P-Glc and the oligosaccharide precursor, facilitating effective glycosylation. The ER is the primary site for the early stages of glycoprotein synthesis, where the initial assembly and modification of glycan structures occur.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG8 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ih (ALG8-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG8-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG8 is a vital enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, facilitating the second glucosylation step necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER and role in glycan assembly underscore its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG8 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in human health.
