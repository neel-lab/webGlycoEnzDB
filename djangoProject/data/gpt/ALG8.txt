Write a 100-350 word essay about human ALG8: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ALG8 (ALG8, Alpha-1,3-Glucosyltransferase) is a crucial enzyme involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a fundamental cellular process for protein folding and maturation. This pathway is essential for the stability and function of many proteins, affecting a wide range of biological processes.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG8 catalyzes the addition of the second glucose residue to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor. This step is crucial in the assembly and maturation of the oligosaccharide chain that is eventually transferred to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The action of ALG8 is a key step in building the complex branched structure of N-linked glycans, critical for proper protein folding and quality control within the ER.

Location:
ALG8 is located in the ER, where the synthesis and initial processing of N-linked glycans occur. The ER is the primary site for the folding and quality control of newly synthesized proteins, making it a critical location for ALG8's activity.

Diseases:
Mutations in the ALG8 gene can lead to a type of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG8-CDG (CDG-Ih). CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Patients with ALG8-CDG typically present with a variety of symptoms, which can include developmental delay, hypotonia, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, and seizures. The severity and range of symptoms reflect the fundamental nature of N-linked glycosylation in numerous cellular functions and protein stability.

Key References:
For more detailed information on ALG8, its function, and related diseases, consider the following key references:
