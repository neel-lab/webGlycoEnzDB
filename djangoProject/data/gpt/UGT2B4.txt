Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT2B4: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT2B4 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B4) is an important enzyme in the body's detoxification system, belonging to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family. UGT2B4 plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process, a vital phase II metabolic reaction. This process involves the conjugation of glucuronic acid to a range of substrates, including steroids, bile acids, and various xenobiotics (foreign chemical substances), which enhances their solubility and facilitates their excretion.

UGT2B4 is predominantly expressed in the liver, a key organ in metabolism and detoxification. Its primary function is to aid in the elimination of potentially harmful compounds by making them more water-soluble. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, processing both endogenous substances, such as hormones, and exogenous compounds, like drugs and carcinogens.

The activity of UGT2B4 is significant in drug metabolism. Variability in UGT2B4 function, due to genetic polymorphisms or environmental factors, can influence the pharmacokinetics of certain medications, impacting their efficacy and safety. For instance, differences in UGT2B4 activity can affect the metabolism of drugs like NSAIDs, influencing their therapeutic effects and side effects.

Additionally, UGT2B4's role in steroid metabolism implicates it in diseases related to hormone regulation. Dysregulation of UGT2B4 may influence the progression of hormone-related cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, by affecting the metabolism of steroid hormones.

For more detailed information on UGT2B4, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
