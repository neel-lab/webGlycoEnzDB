### Function
Human UGT2B4, or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B4, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the detoxification and metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds through glucuronidation. UGT2B4 catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid to a wide range of substances, including bile acids, steroid hormones, and certain medications. This process increases the solubility of these compounds, making them easier to excrete from the body, thereby helping maintain metabolic balance and protect against the accumulation of potentially harmful substances.

### Reaction Pathways
UGT2B4 functions within the glucuronidation pathway, a crucial phase II metabolic process. The enzyme transfers glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amino groups on its substrates, such as bile acids and steroid hormones like androgens and estrogens. This reaction enhances the solubility of these molecules, facilitating their elimination via bile or urine. UGT2B4 is particularly important in the metabolism of bile acids, aiding in their detoxification and preventing their accumulation, which could lead to liver toxicity.

### Location
UGT2B4 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a central role in detoxification processes and the metabolism of endogenous substances like bile acids. The liver's critical function in filtering and processing blood makes it an ideal location for UGT2B4's activity. The enzyme is also expressed in other tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, where it contributes to the localized metabolism and elimination of various compounds.

### Diseases
Alterations in UGT2B4 activity can have significant implications for health, particularly in relation to bile acid metabolism and hormone regulation. Genetic polymorphisms in the UGT2B4 gene can lead to variations in enzyme activity, potentially affecting the body’s ability to process and excrete bile acids and hormones. This could contribute to conditions such as cholestasis, where bile flow is impaired, leading to liver damage, or hormone-related cancers, where dysregulation of hormone levels plays a key role. Understanding UGT2B4’s role in these pathways is essential for developing targeted therapies for conditions related to impaired glucuronidation.
