### Function
Human PIGW, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class W, is an enzyme crucial for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that tether certain proteins to the cell membrane, playing key roles in processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGW is specifically responsible for adding an acyl chain to the inositol ring of the GPI precursor, a critical modification required for the stability and function of GPI-anchored proteins.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGW functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During this process, PIGW catalyzes the acylation of the inositol ring on the GPI anchor precursor, using an acyl-CoA donor. This acylation step is essential for the proper assembly and maturation of GPI anchors, ensuring that the GPI-anchored proteins are firmly attached to the cell membrane and can perform their biological functions effectively.

### Location
PIGW is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where the initial stages of protein synthesis and post-translational modifications occur. The ER provides the appropriate environment for PIGW to interact with other enzymes in the GPI biosynthesis pathway, facilitating the acylation of the GPI anchor precursor. The enzyme’s presence in the ER is vital for ensuring that GPI anchors are correctly modified and functional by the time they reach the cell surface.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGW gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), particularly a condition known as hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS). This rare genetic disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, seizures, and various developmental abnormalities. The disorder arises from defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to improperly anchored proteins and subsequent cellular dysfunction. Understanding PIGW’s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is crucial for diagnosing and developing potential therapies for these conditions.
