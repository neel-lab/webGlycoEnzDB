Write a 100-350 word essay about human HEXB: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

HEXB, or beta-hexosaminidase B, is a crucial lysosomal enzyme that, along with its isoenzyme HexA, participates in the degradation of GM2 gangliosides and other glycoconjugates. This enzyme is key in the breakdown and recycling of complex carbohydrates in the lysosomes, and its dysfunction can lead to severe metabolic disorders.

The primary function of HEXB is to hydrolyze the N-acetylhexosamines from the terminal ends of glycoconjugates, including glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans. This enzymatic activity is essential for the degradation and recycling of these biomolecules, preventing their accumulation in the lysosomes.

HEXB operates within the lysosomal degradation pathway, playing a vital role in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. It works in conjunction with HexA in the hydrolysis of GM2 gangliosides, a type of glycosphingolipid found in nerve cell membranes. The proper functioning of HEXB is crucial for maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis.

Located in the lysosomes, HEXB is strategically positioned to participate in the degradation of glycoconjugates. Lysosomes are the cell's recycling center, and enzymes like HEXB are critical for their function in breaking down and recycling various biomolecules.

Mutations in the HEXB gene can lead to Sandhoff disease, a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. This disease is characterized by the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the lysosomes due to the deficiency of HexB activity. Clinically, Sandhoff disease manifests with a wide range of symptoms, including neurodegeneration, motor skill regression, and, in severe cases, can lead to early childhood death.

For more detailed information on HEXB, the following key scientific references are recommended:

"Lysosomal β-Hexosaminidases (HexA and HexB)" in "Glycobiology"​​.
"HEXB Gene and Sandhoff Disease" in the journal "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease".
"Glycosphingolipid Degradation and Human Disorders" in "Journal of Lipid Research".
"Lysosomal Storage Diseases and the Role of Lysosomal Enzymes" in "Human Genetics".
These resources provide insights into the enzymatic functions of HEXB, its impact on glycoconjugate processing, and its association with Sandhoff disease.
