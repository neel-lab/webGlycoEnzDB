Write a 100-350 word essay about human CHST6: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.



Human CHST6, known as Carbohydrate (N-Acetylglucosamine 6-O) Sulfotransferase 6, is a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (KS-GAG). KS-GAG is a major component of the extracellular matrix in various tissues, particularly in the cornea. CHST6 is responsible for the sulfation of the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in keratan sulfate. This sulfation process, occurring at the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc, is vital for the proper function of keratan sulfate, including its role in cell signaling, adhesion, and tissue hydration.

CHST6 is expressed in the human cornea and contributes significantly to the structural and functional integrity of the corneal matrix. The enzyme's activity in sulfating GlcNAc residues is coupled to the elongation step of the KS-GAG chain, a process critical for the formation of fully functional keratan sulfate.

Notably, mutations in the CHST6 gene have been identified as a cause of macular corneal dystrophy (MCD), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive vision loss due to corneal clouding and opacification. This link between CHST6 mutations and MCD underscores the enzyme's crucial role in maintaining corneal clarity and function.

For more detailed information on human CHST6, the following key references are recommended:

Nakazawa et al. (1984) and Hasegawa et al. (2000): Provide insights into the role of CHST6 in the human cornea and its involvement in keratan sulfate synthesis.
Akama et al. (2000), Uchimura and Rosen (2006): Explore the genetic aspects of CHST6, including its association with macular corneal dystrophy.
Understanding the function of CHST6 in keratan sulfate biosynthesis is crucial for advancing knowledge in ocular health and disease, particularly in understanding the molecular basis of corneal dystrophies like MCD​​​​.
