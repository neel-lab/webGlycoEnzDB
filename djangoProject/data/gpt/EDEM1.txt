Human EDEM1 (ER Degradation Enhancing α-Mannosidase Like Protein 1) plays a pivotal role in the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway, a crucial cellular process for maintaining protein quality control. EDEM1’s function is integral to the identification and disposal of misfolded glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preventing their accumulation and ensuring cellular homeostasis.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
EDEM1 is involved in recognizing misfolded glycoproteins in the ER. It specifically targets proteins with mannose-rich glycans, marking them for degradation. EDEM1 accelerates the extraction of these misfolded proteins from the ER and directs them towards the proteasome for degradation, a process crucial for preventing the accumulation of defective proteins that could disrupt cellular functions. EDEM1’s activity is part of a larger quality control system within the ER that distinguishes between properly folded proteins and those that need to be degraded, a process essential for cellular health and function.

Location:
EDEM1 is located in the ER, where protein folding and initial post-translational modifications occur. Its presence in the ER is strategic for monitoring and managing the quality of newly synthesized glycoproteins.

Diseases:
Disruptions in the ERAD pathway, including the malfunctioning of EDEM1, can lead to a range of diseases. Improper functioning of EDEM1 may result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins, contributing to ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), potentially leading to diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and cancer. EDEM1 is also implicated in viral infections, as some viruses can exploit the ERAD pathway to enhance their replication.

Key References:
For more detailed information on EDEM1, consider the following key references:
