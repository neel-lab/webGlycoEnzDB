Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT2B11: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

As of my last update in April 2023, human UGT2B11 is not a recognized enzyme in the UDP Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family. It's possible that UGT2B11 might be a less well-characterized member of the UGT family, or it could be an erroneous or outdated designation. The UGT family, including well-studied members like UGT2B7 and UGT2B15, is crucial in the body's detoxification processes, participating in the glucuronidation of various substances.

The UGT enzymes are primarily located in the liver, but they are also present in other tissues, including the kidney, intestines, and brain. These enzymes play a vital role in the phase II metabolism of numerous compounds, including drugs, environmental toxins, and endogenous substances. By conjugating these substances with glucuronic acid, UGT enzymes enhance their water solubility, facilitating their elimination from the body.

The activity of UGT enzymes can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect drug metabolism and susceptibility to certain diseases. For example, variations in UGT2B7 can impact the metabolism of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), while UGT2B15 is involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones and certain psychoactive drugs.

For comprehensive information on the UGT enzyme family, including their functions, reaction pathways, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
