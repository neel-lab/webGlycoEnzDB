Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGA: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGA (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class A) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are complex glycolipids that tether certain proteins to the cell surface. PIGA specifically catalyzes an early step in GPI anchor biosynthesis: the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI). This reaction is essential for the formation of GPI anchors that are subsequently attached to various proteins, thereby playing a key role in protein targeting and signal transduction.

PIGA is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it initiates the GPI anchor synthesis process. GPI-anchored proteins are involved in a range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response. They are particularly important on the surface of blood cells and other types of cells in the immune system.

Mutations in the PIGA gene can lead to a rare condition known as Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), which can lead to various symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty breathing, and an increased risk of blood clots. PNH occurs when mutations in the PIGA gene in hematopoietic stem cells lead to a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins on the surface of blood cells, making them susceptible to destruction by the immune system.

For more information on PIGA and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:
