Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGQ: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGQ (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class Q) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are complex glycolipids that covalently link to the C-terminus of specific proteins, thereby anchoring them to the cell surface. These GPI-anchored proteins play critical roles in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

PIGQ is involved in the early stages of GPI anchor synthesis. Specifically, it participates in the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI), forming N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol. This step is crucial for initiating the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, as the GPI precursor undergoes several modifications before being attached to proteins.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGQ functions within the intricate enzymatic process that constructs GPI anchors. Proper GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for the correct localization, stability, and functioning of a wide array of proteins on the cell surface.

Mutations in PIGQ and other genes involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis can lead to GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs), a group of rare genetic disorders. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and various other symptoms, underscoring the importance of GPI-anchored proteins in developmental and neurological processes.
