### Function
Human PIGQ, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class Q, is an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are critical glycolipid structures that attach certain proteins to the cell membrane, enabling them to participate in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune responses, and cell adhesion. PIGQ is a key component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, where it facilitates the initial transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol, marking the first committed step in GPI anchor biosynthesis.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGQ functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this pathway, PIGQ, as part of the GPI-GnT complex, catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol, forming GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol. This initial step is crucial for the subsequent modifications that lead to the formation of a mature GPI anchor. These GPI anchors are then used to attach proteins to the cell membrane, ensuring their proper localization and function.

### Location
PIGQ is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where the early steps of GPI anchor biosynthesis occur. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGQ to interact with other components of the GPI-GnT complex, ensuring that the initial stages of GPI anchor assembly proceed correctly. The enzyme’s localization in the ER is essential for its role in initiating the GPI anchor biosynthesis process.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGQ gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), which are rare genetic disorders characterized by a variety of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. These conditions arise due to defective GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to the improper function or absence of GPI-anchored proteins. The resulting disruption in critical cellular processes contributes to the clinical manifestations of IGDs. Understanding PIGQ’s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is vital for diagnosing and developing treatments for these disorders.
