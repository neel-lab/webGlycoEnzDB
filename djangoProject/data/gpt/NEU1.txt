Write a 100-350 word essay about human NEU1 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human NEU1 (Sialidase-1 or Neuraminidase 1) is a critical lysosomal enzyme involved in the catabolism of sialic acid-containing compounds, particularly glycoproteins and glycolipids. NEU1 primarily catalyzes the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from these complex molecules, a process essential for their degradation and recycling within cells.

Located in the lysosomes, NEU1 is part of the enzymatic machinery responsible for breaking down glycoconjugates. The efficient functioning of NEU1 is vital in the lysosomal degradation pathway, ensuring the regular turnover of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates and preventing their accumulation in cells. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

Deficiency or dysfunction in NEU1 leads to a lysosomal storage disorder known as Sialidosis. Sialidosis is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of sialylated compounds in the lysosomes due to impaired breakdown. This disorder presents in two main forms: Sialidosis Type I, a milder form with onset typically in adolescence or adulthood, characterized by myoclonus, ataxia, and vision problems; and Sialidosis Type II, a more severe form with earlier onset, manifesting with additional symptoms like skeletal deformities, coarse facial features, and developmental delay.

For more detailed information on NEU1 and its associated disease, Sialidosis, the following key references are recommended:
