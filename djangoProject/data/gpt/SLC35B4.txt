Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35B4 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35B4, part of the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family, functions as a nucleotide sugar transporter, specifically for UDP-xylose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). This transporter plays an integral role in the glycosylation process, crucial for the synthesis and modification of various biomolecules including proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.

SLC35B4 is located in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus and is responsible for transporting UDP-xylose and UDP-GlcNAc from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen. Inside the Golgi, these sugar nucleotides are used as substrates by specific glycosyltransferases. UDP-xylose is particularly important in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are components of proteoglycans involved in forming the extracellular matrix, while UDP-GlcNAc is a versatile sugar nucleotide used in various glycosylation pathways.

The efficient function of SLC35B4 is essential for the proper formation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix and for the stability and function of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Dysfunctions in SLC35B4 can potentially lead to abnormalities in these crucial biological components, affecting multiple systems in the body.

While direct links between specific diseases and SLC35B4 mutations are not extensively documented, disruptions in glycosylation pathways, to which SLC35B4 contributes, have been known to be associated with various disorders. These include congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), which are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, leading to a wide range of symptoms depending on the type and severity of the glycosylation defect.

For more detailed information on SLC35B4, its function, and role in glycosylation, the following key references are recommended:
