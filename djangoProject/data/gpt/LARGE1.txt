### Function
Human LARGE1 (like-glycosyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG), a protein essential for the structural stability of muscle cells and for cell signaling. LARGE1 catalyzes the addition of repeating disaccharide units composed of xylose and glucuronic acid to α-DG. This glycosylation is crucial for the proper functioning of α-DG, enabling it to interact with extracellular matrix proteins like laminin, which is vital for muscle integrity and neural development.

### Reaction Pathways
LARGE1 functions within the glycosylation pathway of α-DG. Specifically, it adds a unique sugar chain known as matriglycan, which is composed of alternating xylose and glucuronic acid residues, to a pre-glycosylated form of α-DG. This modification is essential for the formation of functional dystroglycan, which links the cytoskeleton of muscle cells to the extracellular matrix, providing structural stability and signaling capabilities. The glycosylation by LARGE1 is a crucial step in the post-translational modification of α-DG, affecting its ability to bind to matrix proteins.

### Location
LARGE1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it carries out the glycosylation of α-DG. The Golgi apparatus is the cellular organelle responsible for processing and modifying proteins before they are transported to their final destinations. In this environment, LARGE1 ensures that α-DG is properly glycosylated, allowing it to function effectively at the cell surface.

### Diseases
Mutations in the LARGE1 gene are associated with congenital muscular dystrophies, particularly a severe form known as dystroglycanopathy. In these conditions, the glycosylation of α-DG is impaired, leading to a loss of its function as a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. This results in muscle weakness, structural defects, and in some cases, brain malformations and intellectual disabilities. Understanding LARGE1’s role in α-DG glycosylation is critical for diagnosing and developing treatments for dystroglycanopathies, which currently have limited therapeutic options.
