Write a 100-350 word essay about human LARGE1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

LARGE1 (like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) is a gene that plays a crucial role in glycosylation, specifically in the modification of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG). It is one of the largest human genes, spanning over 660 kb and containing 16 exons, and encodes a 756-amino acid protein.

Functionally, LARGE1 is involved in the glycosylation of α-DG, a process essential for the proper functioning of this protein. α-DG is a key component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in muscle cells, which links the cytoskeleton of a muscle fiber to the surrounding extracellular matrix. The glycosylation by LARGE1 enhances the ability of α-DG to bind to laminin and other components in the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for muscle integrity and function.

LARGE1 participates in the post-translational modification pathway, specifically in the addition of glycan chains to α-DG. This modification is vital for the stabilization and localization of α-DG in the muscle cell membrane.

The mutation of the LARGE1 gene leads to defective glycosylation of α-DG. This defect is associated with a group of genetic disorders known as dystroglycanopathies, which are characterized by a spectrum of muscular and neurological abnormalities, ranging from mild to severe. Dystroglycanopathies often present as various forms of muscular dystrophy and can include brain and eye anomalies.
