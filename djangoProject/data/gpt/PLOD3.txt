### Function
Human PLOD3, or procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3, is an enzyme essential for the post-translational modification of collagen. PLOD3 has a unique function among the PLOD family enzymes as it not only hydroxylates lysine residues in collagen, converting them into hydroxylysine, but also glycosylates hydroxylysine residues. These modifications are critical for the stability, assembly, and function of collagen fibers, which form the structural backbone of connective tissues.

### Reaction Pathways
PLOD3 operates within the collagen biosynthesis pathway, where it performs two key reactions: hydroxylation and glycosylation of lysine residues. The hydroxylation of lysine by PLOD3 requires molecular oxygen, iron, and 2-oxoglutarate as cofactors. Once hydroxylated, these lysine residues can be further modified by the addition of galactose or glucose, a reaction also catalyzed by PLOD3. These modifications are essential for the cross-linking of collagen fibers, contributing to the tensile strength and integrity of the extracellular matrix, particularly in tissues like skin, bones, and blood vessels.

### Location
PLOD3 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a critical role in collagen synthesis and modification. The ER provides the necessary environment for PLOD3 to hydroxylate and glycosylate lysine residues in procollagen molecules before they are secreted and assembled into mature collagen fibers. This ER localization ensures that collagen undergoes the proper post-translational modifications required for its structural and functional roles in the body.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PLOD3 gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders, including a condition known as connective tissue disorder type 3, which can manifest with symptoms such as skin hyperelasticity, joint hypermobility, and vascular complications. Defective PLOD3 activity leads to abnormal collagen formation, resulting in weakened connective tissues and a range of clinical symptoms depending on the severity and location of the collagen defects. Understanding PLOD3â€™s role is crucial for diagnosing and developing treatments for these disorders, which can significantly impact quality of life.
