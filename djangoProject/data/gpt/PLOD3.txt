Write a 100-350 word essay about human PLOD3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PLOD3 (Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase 3) is an enzyme crucial for collagen biosynthesis and extracellular matrix formation. It belongs to the family of lysyl hydroxylases, which play a significant role in the post-translational modification of collagen, a primary structural protein in connective tissues.

PLOD3 is responsible for hydroxylating specific lysine residues in collagen peptides, a vital process for the maturation and stabilization of collagen fibrils. This hydroxylation reaction contributes to the cross-linking of collagen fibers, enhancing the tensile strength and structural integrity of connective tissues such as skin, bones, cartilage, and tendons.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PLOD3's activity is essential for the proper formation of collagen triple helices and the subsequent assembly of robust and functional collagen networks. The precise regulation of collagen hydroxylation by PLOD3 is critical for maintaining the balance between flexibility and stability in connective tissues.

Dysfunction or mutations in the PLOD3 gene can lead to abnormalities in collagen synthesis, potentially contributing to various connective tissue disorders. While direct links between specific diseases and PLOD3 mutations are not extensively documented, aberrations in collagen processing can have significant implications for tissue integrity and function. Disorders in collagen structure and formation, such as certain types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can manifest as joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility.

For more detailed information on PLOD3 and its role in connective tissue health, the following key references are recommended:
