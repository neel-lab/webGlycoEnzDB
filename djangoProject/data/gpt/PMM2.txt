Write a 100-350 word essay about human PMM2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PMM2 (Phosphomannomutase 2) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of N-linked glycoproteins. It catalyzes the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, an essential step in the formation of GDP-mannose. GDP-mannose is a vital donor substrate for glycosylation, the process of adding sugar moieties to proteins or lipids, which is crucial for their proper function and cellular localization.

PMM2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Its role in the synthesis of GDP-mannose places it at a pivotal point in the N-glycosylation pathway. N-glycosylation, occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, is critical for protein folding, stability, and trafficking, affecting a wide range of cellular processes.

Mutations in the PMM2 gene can lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Type Ia (PMM2-CDG, formerly known as CDG-Ia). PMM2-CDG is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms due to the under-glycosylation of glycoproteins. These symptoms can include developmental delay, intellectual disability, failure to thrive, and various other systemic issues. The severity and range of symptoms vary widely among individuals with PMM2-CDG.
