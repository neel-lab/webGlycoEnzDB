### Function
Human PIGT, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class T, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the final step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that tether proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating various cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGT is an essential component of the GPI transamidase complex, which catalyzes the transfer of the GPI anchor to proteins, enabling their attachment to the cell membrane.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGT functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, specifically during the GPI transamidation process. As part of the GPI transamidase complex, PIGT facilitates the attachment of GPI anchors to the carboxyl terminus of precursor proteins after the signal peptide is cleaved. This step is critical for ensuring that proteins are correctly anchored to the cell membrane, where they can perform their biological functions. The successful attachment of GPI anchors, mediated by PIGT, is essential for the stability and functionality of many membrane-bound proteins.

### Location
PIGT is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of protein synthesis and initial post-translational modifications. The ER provides the environment necessary for PIGT to interact with other components of the GPI transamidase complex and with precursor proteins, ensuring that GPI anchors are properly attached. The enzyme's presence in the ER is vital for its role in the final stages of GPI anchor biosynthesis and protein maturation.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGT gene are associated with a range of disorders known as inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs). These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological impairments. The defective attachment of GPI anchors due to PIGT mutations results in the mislocalization and dysfunction of GPI-anchored proteins, which are critical for numerous cellular processes. Understanding PIGTâ€™s role is important for diagnosing and potentially treating these conditions.
