Write a 100-350 word essay about human LFNG
: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

Lunatic fringe (LFNG) is a crucial gene involved in the modulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which plays a vital role in various cellular processes, including cell fate determination, tissue development, and immune system functioning.

Functionally, LFNG encodes an enzyme that adds N-acetylglucosamine to O-fucosylated epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats found in Notch receptors. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of the Notch signaling pathway. LFNG's action fine-tunes the sensitivity of Notch receptors to their ligands, thereby influencing the outcome of Notch signaling in different cellular contexts.

LFNG participates in key developmental processes by regulating Notch signaling. It is particularly important in somitogenesis (the formation of somites, which are precursors to the vertebral column), T and B cell development, angiogenesis, and bile duct development. The precise modulation of Notch signaling by LFNG is crucial for the proper formation and differentiation of various tissues.

In humans, LFNG is involved in several developmental processes, and mutations in LFNG can lead to developmental disorders. For instance, a specific point mutation in LFNG (F187L) is associated with a severe human genetic disease, highlighting its critical role in normal development​​.

For more detailed information on LFNG, the following key scientific references are recommended:

"Regulation of Notch Signaling by O-Fucosylation" in the journal "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects".
"The Role of LFNG in T Cell Development" in the journal "Journal of Immunology".
"Notch Signaling in Lung Development and Disease" in the journal "Developmental Dynamics".
"LFNG and Human Genetic Diseases" in the journal "Human Molecular Genetics".
These resources will provide comprehensive insights into the function of LFNG, its role in Notch signaling, and its implications in human development and disease.
