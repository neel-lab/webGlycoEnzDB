Write a 100-350 word essay about human SULF2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SULF2 (Sulfatase 2) is an enzyme with a significant role in the modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are vital components of the extracellular matrix and cell surface. Similar to its homolog SULF1, SULF2 selectively removes sulfate groups from heparan sulfate chains, a process that modulates the biological functions of HSPGs in cell signaling, growth factor binding, and cell-matrix interactions.

Located on the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix, SULF2's primary function is to alter the sulfation pattern of heparan sulfate, impacting the interaction of HSPGs with various signaling molecules. This regulation is crucial in multiple signaling pathways, especially those involving growth factors like fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Wnt. By modifying the binding affinity and availability of these growth factors, SULF2 plays a role in processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration.

The activity of SULF2 has been implicated in a range of diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. Aberrant expression of SULF2 is observed in various tumor types and is associated with altered tumor growth and metastasis. In certain cancers, increased SULF2 activity can enhance growth factor signaling, promoting tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastatic potential. Conversely, the inhibition of SULF2 has been explored as a therapeutic approach to suppress tumor growth in some contexts.

For more in-depth information on SULF2, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
