Human CHST5 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 5) is an enzyme crucial for the modification of glycosaminoglycans, particularly in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate. CHST5 plays a significant role in ocular tissues and has implications in certain eye-related disorders.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CHST5 primarily catalyzes the sulfation of keratan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan present in various tissues, including the cornea. It transfers sulfate groups to specific positions on the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues within the keratan sulfate polysaccharide chain. This modification is essential for the proper function of keratan sulfate, which includes maintaining transparency in the cornea, providing structural support, and facilitating cell signaling. The sulfation process enhances keratan sulfate's ability to bind to other molecules, affecting tissue hydration and resilience.

Location:
CHST5 is located in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of glycosaminoglycans. Its activity in the Golgi is crucial for the sulfation of keratan sulfate, ensuring that this glycosaminoglycan is correctly modified before being transported to the extracellular matrix, particularly in the cornea.

Diseases:
Mutations or dysfunction in CHST5 have been linked to corneal diseases. Specifically, CHST5 mutations are associated with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive loss of corneal transparency, leading to vision impairment. MCD results from the accumulation of unsulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea, highlighting the critical role of CHST5 in maintaining corneal clarity and function.

Key References:
For more detailed information on CHST5, consider the following key references:

1. **"Molecular genetics of macular corneal dystrophy: CHST6 mutations and their role in disease" by Akama et al. in Progress in Retinal and Eye Research (2004).
