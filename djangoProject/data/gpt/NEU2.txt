Write a 100-350 word essay about human NEU2 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human NEU2 (Sialidase-2 or Neuraminidase 2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the metabolism of sialic acids, a family of nine-carbon sugars that are key components of glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids. NEU2 specifically catalyzes the cleavage of terminal sialic acid residues from these complex molecules, a crucial step in their catabolic processing.

Unlike NEU1, which is localized in lysosomes, NEU2 is primarily found in the cytosol. This distinct localization suggests a different functional role for NEU2 in cellular metabolism. Its activity in the cytosol contributes to the regulation of sialylated structures on glycoconjugates, impacting various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, signaling, and immune responses.

While direct links between NEU2 dysfunction and specific diseases are not as extensively documented as other sialidases like NEU1, alterations in sialic acid metabolism can potentially contribute to various pathological conditions. Dysregulated NEU2 activity could impact processes such as inflammation, cancer progression, and neuronal development. Given the importance of sialic acids in cellular interactions and signaling, aberrations in NEU2 function might influence these critical processes.

For more information on NEU2 and its role in sialic acid metabolism, the following key references are recommended:
