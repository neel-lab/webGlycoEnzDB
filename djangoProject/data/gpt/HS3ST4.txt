### Function
Human HS3ST4, or heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 4, is an enzyme involved in the modification of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan critical for numerous biological processes. HS3ST4 specifically catalyzes the addition of a sulfate group to the 3-O position of glucosamine residues within heparan sulfate chains. This specific sulfation is essential for creating binding sites on heparan sulfate that interact with various proteins, including those involved in blood coagulation, cellular signaling, and viral entry.

### Reaction Pathways
HS3ST4 functions in the heparan sulfate biosynthesis pathway, where it is responsible for the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues. This modification plays a key role in the functional diversification of heparan sulfate, enabling it to bind to specific proteins such as antithrombin, which is involved in regulating blood coagulation, and chemokines, which are crucial for immune responses. The 3-O-sulfated sites created by HS3ST4 are also critical in mediating interactions with growth factors and other signaling molecules, thereby influencing cell growth, differentiation, and development.

### Location
HS3ST4 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular organelle where protein and lipid modification, sorting, and packaging occur. Within the Golgi, HS3ST4 adds the 3-O-sulfate group to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, ensuring that these molecules are properly modified before they are transported to the cell surface or extracellular matrix. This location is essential for HS3ST4 to carry out its function in the final stages of heparan sulfate maturation.

### Diseases
Alterations in the function or expression of HS3ST4 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and viral infections. In cancer, abnormal sulfation patterns due to dysregulated HS3ST4 activity can contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by affecting cell signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, utilize 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate as a receptor for entry into host cells, making HS3ST4 a potential target for antiviral therapies. Understanding the role of HS3ST4 in these diseases is crucial for developing strategies to modulate heparan sulfate function in therapeutic contexts.
