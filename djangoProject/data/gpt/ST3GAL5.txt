Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST3GAL5: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ST3GAL5 (ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 5), commonly known as GM3 synthase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. ST3GAL5 catalyzes the addition of sialic acid to lactosylceramide, forming the ganglioside GM3, an essential component of cell membranes.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST3GAL5 is involved in the initial step of ganglioside synthesis. Gangliosides, such as GM3, are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids that play vital roles in cell recognition, signaling, and interaction processes. They are particularly abundant in the nervous system, where they contribute to neural development, synaptic function, and neuronal protection.

Disruptions in ST3GAL5 function can lead to serious health implications. Mutations in the ST3GAL5 gene have been associated with a rare disorder known as salt and pepper syndrome (SPS), or Amish infantile epilepsy syndrome. This condition is characterized by developmental delays, epileptic seizures, visual impairment, and distinctive skin pigmentation anomalies. The pathology of SPS is thought to be related to the absence or reduced levels of GM3 and other downstream gangliosides, which are crucial for normal neural development and function.

For more detailed information on ST3GAL5 and its role in ganglioside biosynthesis and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
