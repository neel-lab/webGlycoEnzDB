Write a 100-350 word essay about human MGAT4A : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human MGAT4A (Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 4A) is an enzyme involved in the process of N-linked glycosylation, an essential pathway in the biosynthesis and modification of glycoproteins. MGAT4A specifically adds N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the mannose residues on the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins, a key step in the formation of complex and hybrid N-glycans.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MGAT4A's activity is crucial for the maturation of glycoproteins. By catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc, MGAT4A influences the structure and function of glycoproteins, impacting their stability, activity, and cellular localization. Glycoproteins modified by MGAT4A are involved in various cellular functions, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein trafficking.

Disruptions in MGAT4A function can lead to abnormalities in glycoprotein processing and are potentially associated with various diseases. While specific diseases directly caused by mutations in the MGAT4A gene are not well-documented, aberrations in the N-linked glycosylation pathway can contribute to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of rare inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, resulting in a wide range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and immune system dysfunctions.

For more detailed information on MGAT4A and its role in glycoprotein processing, the following key references are recommended:
