Human ALG9 (ALG9, Alpha-1,2-Mannosyltransferase) plays a pivotal role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, an essential process for protein folding and maturation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is crucial for the stability and functionality of a wide range of proteins.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG9 is responsible for adding mannose residues to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor during the assembly of the N-linked glycan. Specifically, it catalyzes the addition of two alpha-1,2-mannose residues in the LLO synthesis. This step is vital in forming a complete oligosaccharide chain that is subsequently transferred to nascent proteins. The addition of these mannose residues by ALG9 is a crucial part of building the complex branched structure of N-linked glycans, which are key to proper protein folding and quality control within the ER.

Location:
ALG9 is localized in the ER, where N-linked glycosylation and the initial steps of protein folding occur. The ER's role as a hub for protein synthesis and maturation underscores the importance of ALG9 in cellular processes.

Diseases:
Mutations in the ALG9 gene can lead to a type of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG9-CDG (CDG-IL). CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Symptoms of ALG9-CDG can be diverse and may include developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, liver dysfunction, and coagulation abnormalities. This variability reflects the fundamental nature of N-linked glycosylation in numerous cellular functions and protein stability.
