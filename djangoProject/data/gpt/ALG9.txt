### Function
Human ALG9 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 9) is a critical enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. It functions as an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase and alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase, adding mannose residues to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. This enzyme plays a vital role in ensuring the proper assembly of the glycan structures necessary for glycoprotein maturation and function.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG9 catalyzes the addition of mannose residues from GDP-mannose to the oligosaccharide intermediate Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. Specifically, ALG9 adds the sixth mannose in an alpha-1,2 linkage to form Man6GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, and then adds the seventh mannose in an alpha-1,3 linkage to form Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. These reactions are crucial steps in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) necessary for N-glycosylation, which will eventually be transferred to nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the ER lumen.

### Location
ALG9 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), embedded in the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. This strategic positioning allows ALG9 to efficiently access its substrates, GDP-mannose and the oligosaccharide precursor, facilitating the critical mannosylation steps in the N-glycosylation pathway. The ER is the primary site for the early stages of glycoprotein synthesis, where initial assembly and modification of glycan structures occur.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG9 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type IL (ALG9-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG9-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, liver dysfunction, and various other systemic issues. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG9 is a vital enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, facilitating key mannosylation steps necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER and its role in glycan assembly underscore its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG9 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting its critical role in human health.
