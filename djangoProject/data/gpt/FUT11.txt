### Function

Human FUT11 (fucosyltransferase 11) is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-fucose to specific positions on glycan structures, specifically adding fucose in an α1,3-linkage to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue of N-glycans. This activity is known as core α1,3-fucosylation, a process crucial for the maturation and function of glycoproteins. The exact biological roles of FUT11 remain to be fully elucidated, but like other fucosyltransferases, it is likely involved in processes such as cell signaling, immune response, and development.

### Reaction Pathways

FUT11 functions within the glycosylation pathway, where it plays a role in modifying N-glycans by adding fucose residues to their core structures. The enzyme uses GDP-fucose as a donor substrate and transfers this sugar to N-glycans during their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This core fucosylation is a critical modification that can influence the folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins.

### Location

FUT11 is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), distinguishing it from many other fucosyltransferases that reside in the Golgi apparatus. This ER localization suggests that FUT11 acts early in the glycoprotein maturation process, adding fucose residues as the glycoproteins are being synthesized and folded. Such localization is essential for ensuring that glycoproteins are properly modified before being transported to their final destinations within or outside the cell.

### Diseases

Although the specific diseases associated with FUT11 mutations are not well documented, altered fucosylation patterns, such as those mediated by FUT11, have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and immune disorders. Changes in the activity of fucosyltransferases can lead to abnormalities in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune recognition, contributing to disease progression. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of FUT11 dysfunction in human health.

In summary, FUT11 is an important enzyme involved in the core fucosylation of N-glycans within the endoplasmic reticulum. While its precise roles in disease are still under investigation, it is likely critical in processes related to glycoprotein maturation and function.
