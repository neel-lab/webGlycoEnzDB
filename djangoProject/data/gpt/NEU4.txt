### Function
Human NEU4, or neuraminidase 4, is an enzyme that hydrolyzes terminal sialic acid residues from sialoglycoconjugates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides. This enzymatic activity is essential for the catabolism of sialylated molecules, which influences a variety of biological processes such as cell signaling, immune response, and the maintenance of cell surface architecture. NEU4 plays a particularly important role in the remodeling of complex gangliosides, which are crucial components of the neuronal cell membrane.

### Reaction Pathways
NEU4 functions in the degradation pathways of sialoglycoconjugates. It acts by cleaving sialic acids from gangliosides and glycoproteins, facilitating their breakdown and recycling within the cell. This process is crucial for the regulation of glycosphingolipid metabolism, affecting the composition and function of the cell membrane. By modulating the levels of sialic acids on the cell surface, NEU4 influences cellular interactions, signal transduction pathways, and the immune response.

### Location
NEU4 is unique among neuraminidases due to its localization in both the lysosome and mitochondria. In lysosomes, NEU4 is involved in the breakdown of sialylated molecules that have been internalized by the cell, contributing to cellular waste management and recycling. Its mitochondrial localization suggests a role in the regulation of mitochondrial function, potentially influencing apoptosis and other mitochondrial processes. This dual localization allows NEU4 to impact a wide range of cellular activities.

### Diseases
Dysregulation of NEU4 has been associated with various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Altered NEU4 activity can lead to abnormal sialylation patterns, affecting cell signaling and promoting tumor progression and metastasis. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, dysregulation of NEU4 may contribute to the accumulation of sialylated proteins and lipids, leading to neuronal dysfunction. Additionally, mutations in the NEU4 gene have been explored as potential contributors to lysosomal storage disorders, where improper degradation of sialoglycoconjugates occurs. Understanding NEU4â€™s function and its role in disease is essential for developing targeted therapies for these conditions.
