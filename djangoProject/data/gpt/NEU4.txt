Write a 100-350 word essay about human NEU4: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human NEU4 (Sialidase-4 or Neuraminidase 4) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of sialic acids, crucial components of glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids. NEU4 specifically catalyzes the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from these molecules, a process essential for the degradation and remodeling of sialylated compounds.

NEU4 exhibits a unique cellular localization compared to other members of the sialidase family. It is found in both the lysosomes and mitochondria, suggesting a diverse range of functions. In lysosomes, NEU4 contributes to the catabolism of sialylated glycoconjugates, playing a role in cellular recycling and turnover. In mitochondria, NEU4 is thought to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis and mitochondrial function, potentially influencing cellular responses to stress and damage.

Alterations in NEU4 activity have been associated with various diseases, though the specific connections are not as well-documented as those of other sialidases. Given its role in lysosomal and mitochondrial functions, dysregulation of NEU4 could potentially contribute to metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and disorders involving lysosomal storage or mitochondrial dysfunction.

For more detailed information on NEU4 and its role in cellular metabolism, the following key references are recommended:
