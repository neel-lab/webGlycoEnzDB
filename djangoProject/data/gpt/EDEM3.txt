### Function

Human EDEM3 (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein 3) is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which ensures the quality control of glycoproteins. EDEM3 recognizes and trims mannose residues from misfolded glycoproteins, marking them for degradation. This enzymatic activity prevents the accumulation of defective proteins in the ER, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis. EDEM3, along with EDEM1 and EDEM2, facilitates the demannosylation process, a key step in the identification and disposal of misfolded glycoproteins.

### Reaction Pathways

EDEM3 specifically targets the α1,2-mannose residues in the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. It catalyzes the conversion of Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2 by removing a single mannose residue. This demannosylation signals the misfolded glycoproteins for retrotranslocation into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. This process is vital for the ERAD pathway, distinguishing properly folded proteins from those that are defective and ensuring only functional proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus and beyond.

### Location

EDEM3 is localized within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This localization is essential for its role in glycoprotein quality control as the ER is the site where nascent glycoproteins are synthesized and initially folded. The presence of EDEM3 in the ER enables it to efficiently identify and process misfolded glycoproteins early in their life cycle, preventing the accumulation of faulty proteins and maintaining the efficiency of the secretory pathway.

### Diseases

While direct mutations in EDEM3 are not commonly associated with specific diseases, dysfunctions in the ERAD pathway, where EDEM3 is a key player, can lead to various disorders. Impairments in this pathway can cause the accumulation of misfolded proteins, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, ER stress and defective protein degradation are implicated in metabolic disorders like diabetes and certain cancers. Therefore, although EDEM3 may not be directly mutated, its malfunction can significantly impact disease progression.

In summary, EDEM3 is vital for the ERAD pathway, ensuring the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins within the ER. Proper functioning of EDEM3 is crucial for cellular health, and its impairment is linked to various serious diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining protein quality control.
