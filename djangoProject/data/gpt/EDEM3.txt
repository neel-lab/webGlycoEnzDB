Write a 100-350 word essay about human EDEM3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human EDEM3 (ER Degradation Enhancing α-Mannosidase Like Protein 3) is an important component of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by managing protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Function and Reaction Pathways:
EDEM3, like other EDEM family members, specializes in recognizing and targeting misfolded glycoproteins for degradation. It possesses α-1,2-mannosidase activity, trimming mannose residues from N-linked glycans on misfolded glycoproteins in the ER. This modification marks these proteins for degradation, thereby preventing the accumulation of non-functional or potentially harmful proteins within the cell. EDEM3’s role is vital in the ERAD pathway, ensuring that only properly folded and functional proteins are allowed to proceed through the secretory pathway.

Location:
EDEM3 is localized to the ER, where protein folding and quality control processes occur. Its strategic location enables it to effectively identify and target misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their removal and degradation.

Diseases:
Dysfunction in EDEM3, and more broadly in the ERAD pathway, can lead to ER stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Persistent ER stress is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s), metabolic disorders (such as diabetes), and certain cancers. EDEM3's specific role in these pathologies is an area of ongoing research, but its fundamental role in protein quality control suggests its potential involvement.

Key References:
For more detailed information on EDEM3, consider the following key references:
