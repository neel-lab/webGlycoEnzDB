Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human PIGG. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human PIGG, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class G, is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are crucial glycolipid structures that tether specific proteins to the cell membrane, where they play key roles in cell signaling, immune response, and adhesion. PIGG specifically adds the fourth mannose residue to the growing GPI anchor, a critical step in the anchor's assembly and maturation.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGG functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After earlier enzymes have added initial mannose residues to the GPI precursor, PIGG catalyzes the addition of the fourth mannose. This step is essential for the completion of the GPI structure, which will undergo further modifications before being attached to proteins. The final GPI-anchored proteins are then transported to the cell surface, where they perform various essential functions.

### Location
PIGG is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle responsible for the synthesis and initial modification of proteins and lipids. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGG to interact with other enzymes in the GPI biosynthesis pathway, ensuring that GPI anchors are correctly assembled. This localization is critical for the enzyme's role in ensuring that GPI-anchored proteins are properly modified and functional when they reach the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGG gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological issues. These conditions arise due to the improper formation of GPI anchors, leading to mislocalization or dysfunction of GPI-anchored proteins. As these proteins are critical for many cellular processes, their dysfunction can result in significant developmental and neurological challenges. Understanding PIGGâ€™s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is vital for diagnosing and developing treatments for these conditions.
