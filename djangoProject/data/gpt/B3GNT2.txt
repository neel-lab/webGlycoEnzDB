Human B3GNT2 (Beta-1,3-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine, a crucial component of various glycoconjugates including glycoproteins and glycolipids. B3GNT2's function is vital for numerous cellular functions, such as cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
B3GNT2 catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a beta-1,3 linkage to a galactose residue, forming the core structure of poly-N-acetyllactosamine. This reaction is essential in the extension of lactosamine chains, found in both N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids. These extended lactosamine chains are critical for the formation of complex carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces, which are involved in cell-cell recognition, signaling, and adhesion processes. They also play a role in the development of the extracellular matrix and in modulating the function of various immune cells.

Location:
B3GNT2 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, the central organelle for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. Its presence in the Golgi is integral for the sequential addition of sugar residues in glycan biosynthesis.

Diseases:
While specific diseases directly linked to B3GNT2 dysfunction are not extensively documented, disruptions in glycosylation processes can have significant impacts. Abnormalities in the function of B3GNT2 could potentially affect cell communication, immune response, and tissue organization. This could lead to a range of pathophysiological conditions, possibly including immune disorders and developmental abnormalities.
