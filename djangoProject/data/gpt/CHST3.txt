Human CHST3 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the modification of glycosaminoglycans, specifically chondroitin sulfate. This modification is essential for the biological function of chondroitin sulfate in various physiological processes, including cartilage formation and maintenance.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CHST3 is responsible for the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate, a key component of the extracellular matrix found particularly in cartilage tissue. It catalyzes the addition of sulfate groups to the 6-position of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues within the chondroitin sulfate chain. This sulfation process is critical as it confers specific biological properties to chondroitin sulfate, including its ability to interact with a range of proteins, such as growth factors and cytokines. These interactions are vital for cell signaling, structural integrity, and tissue hydration. CHST3's activity is crucial in determining the degree of sulfation of chondroitin sulfate, thereby influencing its function in connective tissues.

Location:
CHST3 is predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of proteoglycans. The Golgi apparatus is a key site for the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, and CHST3’s presence there ensures the proper modification of chondroitin sulfate as part of the biosynthesis process.

Diseases:
Mutations in the CHST3 gene can lead to skeletal disorders, such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Omani type and autosomal recessive Larsen syndrome. These conditions are characterized by abnormal bone growth, joint dislocations, and other skeletal abnormalities, highlighting the importance of CHST3 in normal skeletal development. The lack of proper sulfation of chondroitin sulfate due to CHST3 dysfunction can impair the structural and functional properties of cartilage, leading to these developmental anomalies.

Key References:
