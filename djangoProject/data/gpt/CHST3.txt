### Function

Human CHST3 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 3), also known as chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C6ST-1), is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups from the donor molecule 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the 6-position of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in chondroitin. This sulfation process is essential for the formation of chondroitin 6-sulfate, a critical component of the extracellular matrix. The sulfation activity of CHST3 is crucial for the structural and functional diversity of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are important for cellular signaling, adhesion, and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues  .

### Reaction Pathways

CHST3 is involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, a significant glycosaminoglycan found in cartilage and other connective tissues. In the Golgi apparatus, CHST3 catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 6-position of GalNAc residues in chondroitin chains. This reaction is a key step in the production of chondroitin sulfate, which interacts with various proteins and cell surface receptors to influence cellular behaviors and extracellular matrix organization. The enzymatic activity of CHST3 ensures that chondroitin sulfate chains are properly sulfated, which is essential for their biological activity  .

### Location

CHST3 is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, functioning as a type II transmembrane protein. Its active site faces the lumen of the Golgi, allowing it to access and sulfate its substrate molecules effectively. This localization is critical for the enzyme's role in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, ensuring that these molecules are correctly sulfated before being transported to their final destinations in the cell or extracellular matrix .

### Diseases

Mutations or dysregulation of CHST3 are associated with several pathological conditions, particularly those affecting the skeletal system and connective tissues. For instance, defects in CHST3 can lead to undersulfation of chondroitin sulfate, which impacts its function and contributes to diseases such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Omani type. This disorder is characterized by congenital skeletal abnormalities, including short stature and joint malformations. Additionally, altered CHST3 expression has been observed in certain cancers, where changes in GAG sulfation patterns can influence tumor growth and metastasis by modifying the extracellular matrix and cell signaling pathways. Understanding the role of CHST3 in these diseases highlights its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions and its potential as a therapeutic target   .

In summary, CHST3 is a vital enzyme in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, contributing to the structural integrity and functionality of the extracellular matrix. Its proper function and regulation are essential for normal cellular processes, and its dysregulation can lead to significant pathological conditions.
