Write a 100-350 word essay about human NAGLU: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human NAGLU (N-acetyl-alpha-glucosaminidase) is a lysosomal enzyme crucial in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces. NAGLU specifically hydrolyzes the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues in the heparan sulfate polymer. This enzymatic action is vital for the stepwise degradation of heparan sulfate, allowing for the recycling of its components within the lysosome.

Located in the lysosomes, NAGLU is part of a catabolic pathway for glycosaminoglycans. Its proper function is essential to prevent the accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans, which can be detrimental to cellular health and function. The lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate by NAGLU and other enzymes is crucial for maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

Deficiency in NAGLU activity leads to a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). This disease is characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate in the lysosomes, leading to progressive neurodegeneration and other severe clinical manifestations, including developmental delay, behavioral problems, and motor function decline. Sanfilippo syndrome type B is a progressive and debilitating condition, significantly impacting the quality of life and lifespan of affected individuals.

For more detailed information on NAGLU and Sanfilippo syndrome type B, the following key references are recommended:
