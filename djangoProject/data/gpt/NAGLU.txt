### Function
Human NAGLU, or alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, is an essential lysosomal enzyme involved in the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically heparan sulfate. NAGLU catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-N-acetylglucosamine residues from heparan sulfate, a crucial step in the degradation of these complex carbohydrates. This enzymatic activity is vital for cellular waste management and the recycling of GAGs, which are important for maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

### Reaction Pathways
NAGLU functions within the lysosomal degradation pathway, specifically in the catabolism of heparan sulfate, a type of GAG found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces. After initial cleavage by other enzymes, NAGLU removes the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues from the non-reducing end of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. This step is essential for the complete degradation of heparan sulfate, allowing its components to be further broken down into simpler molecules that the cell can reuse or eliminate.

### Location
NAGLU is localized in lysosomes, the cellular organelles responsible for breaking down and recycling various macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. The acidic environment of the lysosome is optimal for NAGLU’s enzymatic activity, enabling it to efficiently degrade heparan sulfate and prevent the accumulation of partially degraded GAGs within the cell.

### Diseases
Mutations in the NAGLU gene cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B. This lysosomal storage disorder is characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate due to deficient NAGLU activity. The buildup of undegraded heparan sulfate leads to severe neurological symptoms, including developmental delay, behavioral problems, and progressive cognitive decline. MPS IIIB is a progressive condition with no cure, and it typically results in early mortality. Understanding NAGLU’s function is critical for diagnosing and developing potential therapies for Sanfilippo syndrome and other related lysosomal storage disorders.
