Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35A1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35A1, also known as the CMP-sialic acid transporter, is a crucial component of the cellular machinery involved in glycosylation, specifically the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SLC35A1 is responsible for transporting cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-sialic acid from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where it serves as a donor substrate for sialyltransferases, enzymes that transfer sialic acid to nascent glycoconjugates.

Located in the Golgi membrane, SLC35A1 plays a pivotal role in the final stages of glycoconjugate synthesis. Sialic acids are important terminal monosaccharides in glycan chains and are involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell interaction, immune response, and pathogen recognition. The proper function of SLC35A1 is, therefore, crucial for the correct sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which impacts their stability, half-life, and biological activity.

Mutations in the SLC35A1 gene can lead to Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type IIf (CDG-IIf), a rare genetic condition. CDG-IIf is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including developmental delay, hypotonia, coagulation abnormalities, and immunodeficiency. The disease stems from impaired glycosylation due to defective transport of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi, resulting in under-sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids.

For more detailed information on SLC35A1 and its association with CDG-IIf, the following key references are recommended:
