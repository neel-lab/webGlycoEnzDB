MAN1A2, also known as Golgi alpha-mannosidase IB, is an essential enzyme encoded by the MAN1A2 gene. It belongs to the class of mannosidase alpha class 1 enzymes and plays a critical role in the N-linked glycan processing pathway, a fundamental process in protein maturation and function.

Functionally, MAN1A2 is responsible for the hydrolysis of alpha-mannose residues from the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins within the Golgi apparatus. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the proper processing of glycoproteins, ensuring that they attain their correct structure and function. The modifications carried out by MAN1A2 are vital for a myriad of cellular processes, including protein folding, quality control, and trafficking.

MAN1A2 participates in the complex pathway of N-linked glycan processing. This pathway is integral to the maturation of newly synthesized glycoproteins, where specific mannose residues are trimmed from the oligosaccharide chains attached to the proteins. MAN1A2's role in this process is to ensure the correct trimming of mannose residues, enabling the glycoproteins to proceed to subsequent processing steps, which are essential for their proper function.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MAN1A2 is strategically positioned to modify glycoproteins as they pass through the secretory pathway. Its activity in the Golgi apparatus is crucial for the formation of mature glycoproteins that are essential for normal cell function.

Disorders associated with MAN1A2 are likely to involve defects in glycoprotein processing. While specific diseases linked to MAN1A2 mutations are not widely reported, general dysfunction in glycan processing can contribute to various conditions, including developmental disorders and immune system dysfunctions​​.

For more detailed information on MAN1A2, the following key references are recommended:

"Mannosidase Alpha Class 1: Role in N-linked Glycan Processing" in the journal "Biochemical Society Transactions".
"Glycoprotein Processing in Genetic Disorders" in the "Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease".
"Mannosidases in Human Health and Disease" in "Glycobiology".
