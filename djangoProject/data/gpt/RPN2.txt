Write a 100-350 word essay about human RPN2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human RPN2 (Ribophorin II) is a crucial component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, playing a significant role in the N-linked glycosylation of nascent proteins. This glycosylation process is vital for protein folding, stability, and function.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), RPN2, alongside other components of the OST complex, facilitates the transfer of an oligosaccharide moiety to specific asparagine residues within the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr of nascent polypeptide chains. This co-translational modification is essential for the proper folding and quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins.

The function of RPN2 extends beyond its enzymatic role in glycosylation. It also assists in maintaining the structural integrity of the OST complex and may influence the recognition and processing of glycosylation sites on substrates.

Disruptions or mutations in RPN2 can potentially lead to abnormal protein glycosylation, impacting protein quality and function. Such alterations could contribute to various diseases, particularly those related to protein misfolding and ER stress. However, specific diseases directly linked to RPN2 mutations are not extensively documented.

For more detailed information on RPN2 and its role in glycosylation, the following key references are recommended:
