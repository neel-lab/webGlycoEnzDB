Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35A3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35A3 is a member of the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family and specifically functions as a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) transporter. SLC35A3 plays a vital role in glycosylation, a process essential for the proper functioning of proteins and lipids in the body.

Located in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus, SLC35A3 is responsible for transporting UDP-GlcNAc from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen. UDP-GlcNAc is a key sugar nucleotide used as a substrate for various glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. This transport is crucial for maintaining the supply of UDP-GlcNAc within the Golgi for the ongoing glycosylation processes, which are fundamental for cell signaling, stability, and communication.

The proper function of SLC35A3 and the glycosylation pathway is essential for numerous biological processes, including immune responses, cell growth, and protein quality control. Dysregulation or mutations in the SLC35A3 gene can potentially lead to abnormalities in glycosylation, affecting multiple systems in the body.

While direct links between specific diseases and SLC35A3 mutations are not extensively documented, aberrations in glycosylation pathways are known to contribute to a range of disorders, including congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). These are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycosylation, leading to a wide variety of symptoms, depending on the type and severity of the glycosylation defect.

For more detailed information on SLC35A3 and its role in glycosylation and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
