Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC2A5: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC2A5, known as GLUT5, is a specialized facilitative transporter primarily responsible for the absorption of fructose, a simple sugar found in many foods. Unlike other members of the GLUT family, GLUT5 is highly specific for fructose and plays a crucial role in dietary fructose uptake.

GLUT5 is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, particularly in the brush border membrane of enterocytes, where it facilitates the absorption of dietary fructose from the gut lumen into the cells. Apart from the small intestine, GLUT5 is also present in sperm cells, where it is believed to provide the fructose necessary for sperm motility and energy.

The efficient function of GLUT5 is essential for the metabolism of fructose, which differs from that of glucose. After absorption, fructose is primarily directed towards the liver, where it undergoes fructolysis. Unlike glucose, fructose metabolism bypasses the rate-controlling steps of glycolysis, leading to distinctive metabolic effects.

Dysfunction or altered expression of GLUT5 can impact fructose absorption and metabolism. While specific diseases directly caused by GLUT5 mutations are rare, impaired or excessive fructose transport due to variations in GLUT5 activity may contribute to metabolic disorders. For instance, malabsorption of fructose can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and diarrhea, while excessive fructose intake and absorption, facilitated by GLUT5, are implicated in conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, and insulin resistance.

For more detailed information on SLC2A5/GLUT5, the following key references are recommended:
