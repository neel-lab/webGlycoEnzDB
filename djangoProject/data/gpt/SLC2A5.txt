Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human SLC2A5. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human SLC2A5, also known as GLUT5, is a fructose transporter that plays a crucial role in the absorption of dietary fructose. Unlike other members of the GLUT family, which primarily transport glucose, GLUT5 is specific for fructose. It facilitates the transport of fructose across cell membranes, particularly in the intestines, enabling the body to utilize fructose as a source of energy.

### Reaction Pathways
GLUT5 functions in the fructose transport pathway, where it mediates the facilitated diffusion of fructose across the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine. After fructose is absorbed from the diet, GLUT5 transports it into the intestinal cells, from where it is eventually released into the bloodstream via another transporter, GLUT2. Fructose can then be taken up by various tissues, such as the liver, where it is metabolized through glycolysis or converted into glucose or fat.

### Location
SLC2A5 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, where it is responsible for the absorption of dietary fructose. GLUT5 is also found in other tissues, including the kidney, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, though its primary role remains in the intestines. In the small intestine, GLUT5 is located on the apical membrane of enterocytes, facilitating the first step in fructose metabolism.

### Diseases
Dysfunction or altered expression of GLUT5 can lead to fructose malabsorption, a condition in which the absorption of fructose in the small intestine is impaired. This can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, as undigested fructose is fermented by bacteria in the colon. Additionally, excessive fructose consumption, often in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, has been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Understanding the role of GLUT5 in fructose metabolism is essential for managing these conditions and promoting metabolic health.
