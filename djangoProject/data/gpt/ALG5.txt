### Function
Human ALG5 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 5) is a glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. Specifically, ALG5 functions as a dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase, catalyzing the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to dolichyl-phosphate (Dol-P) to form dolichyl-phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc). This reaction is crucial for the initial steps of the N-linked glycosylation pathway, impacting the proper assembly and function of glycoproteins.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG5 participates in the glycosylation pathway by catalyzing the formation of Dol-P-Glc from UDP-Glc and Dol-P. This enzymatic activity is essential for the glucosylation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The Dol-P-Glc produced by ALG5 serves as a substrate for subsequent glycosyltransferases, including ALG6, ALG8, and ALG10, which further modify the oligosaccharide structure during the final stages of its assembly. This stepwise construction is vital for producing the mature glycan structures necessary for proper protein folding and function.

### Location
ALG5 is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) membrane. The enzyme is embedded in the ER membrane, with its active site facing the cytosolic side, where it interacts with its substrates, UDP-Glc and Dol-P. This localization is strategic, as the ER is the primary site for the early stages of protein glycosylation. The correct positioning of ALG5 ensures efficient participation in the glycosylation pathway and the proper synthesis of glycoproteins.

### Diseases
Currently, no specific human diseases have been directly linked to deficiencies or mutations in the ALG5 gene. However, given the enzyme's critical role in glycosylation, a deficiency in ALG5 activity is expected to potentially lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). CDGs are characterized by defects in glycoprotein biosynthesis, leading to a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and various systemic dysfunctions. Further clinical and genetic research may identify specific mutations in ALG5 that could cause such disorders.

In summary, human ALG5 is a vital enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, facilitating the formation of dolichyl-phosphate glucose necessary for glycoprotein synthesis. Its localization in the ER and role in glycan assembly underscore its importance in cellular function, and potential deficiencies could lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting its critical role in human health.
