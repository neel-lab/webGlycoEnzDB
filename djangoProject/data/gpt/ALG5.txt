Human ALG5 (Dolichyl-Phosphate Beta-Glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a fundamental process for protein folding and maturation in eukaryotic cells. This pathway is essential for the proper functioning of many proteins.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG5 catalyzes the addition of a glucose molecule to dolichyl phosphate, a lipid carrier, to form dolichyl phosphate glucose. This step is vital in the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor, which is key to the N-linked glycosylation process. N-linked glycosylation involves the attachment of an oligosaccharide to specific asparagine residues of nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This modification is crucial for proper protein folding, stability, and function.

Location:
ALG5 is localized in the ER, where the synthesis of LLO and the early steps of N-linked glycosylation take place. The ER is the cellular hub for protein synthesis and maturation, making it a critical site for ALG5 activity.

Diseases:
Mutations or dysfunction in ALG5 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG5-CDG (also known as CDG-Ik). CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the glycosylation process, leading to a wide range of clinical symptoms. Patients with ALG5-CDG may present with developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and other symptoms reflecting the vital role of glycosylation in numerous cellular functions.
