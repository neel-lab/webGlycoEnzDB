Write a 100-350 word essay about human B3GLCT: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human B3GLCT (Beta-1,3-Glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme with a specialized function in the post-translational modification of proteins, particularly in the biosynthesis of the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen. This enzyme's activity is crucial for various biological processes, including cell signaling and immune response.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
B3GLCT catalyzes the addition of glucose to the core 1 structure of mucin-type O-glycans, a type of glycosylation where sugar molecules are attached to oxygen atoms in serine or threonine residues of proteins. The TF antigen, produced by this enzymatic action, is found on a variety of cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells. The TF antigen plays a role in cell adhesion, signaling, and immune recognition. It is also implicated in cancer progression, as it is highly expressed on the surface of many cancer cells and is involved in tumor metastasis and immune evasion.

Location:
B3GLCT is located in the Golgi apparatus, the cell's hub for the sorting and modification of proteins and lipids. This localization is consistent with its role in the glycosylation of proteins, a key post-translational modification process.

Diseases:
Mutations in the B3GLCT gene are linked to Peters Plus syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This syndrome is characterized by ocular defects, short stature, developmental delay, and other anomalies. The disorder highlights the importance of B3GLCT in normal development and tissue function. Additionally, the enzyme's role in the biosynthesis of the TF antigen links it to cancer biology, particularly in the context of tumor progression and metastasis.

Key References:
