### Function
Human B3GLCT (Beta-1,3-Glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically in the O-glycosylation pathway. It catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to a hydroxylysine residue on proteins, forming a beta-1,3-glucosidic linkage. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the proper functioning of a subset of proteins, including those involved in extracellular matrix formation and stability.

### Reaction Pathways
B3GLCT facilitates the glycosylation reaction by transferring a glucose molecule from the donor substrate UDP-glucose to an acceptor hydroxylysine residue on target proteins. This process is part of the O-glycosylation pathway, which is essential for modifying proteins involved in cellular adhesion and signaling. The enzyme's activity ensures the proper assembly and functionality of glycosylated proteins, which are critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix.

### Location
B3GLCT is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a type II transmembrane protein. Its positioning within these organelles allows it to access nascent proteins and UDP-glucose efficiently, facilitating the glycosylation process. The ER and Golgi are central hubs for protein modification and trafficking, making them ideal locations for B3GLCT to perform its enzymatic functions.

### Diseases
Mutations in the B3GLCT gene are associated with a rare genetic disorder known as Peters-plus syndrome (PPS). This syndrome is characterized by ocular abnormalities (such as Peters anomaly), short stature, brachydactyly, and developmental delays. The dysfunction of B3GLCT leads to defective glycosylation of target proteins, which disrupts their normal function and contributes to the clinical manifestations of PPS. The enzyme's critical role in glycosylation underscores its importance in human development and health.

In summary, human B3GLCT is a vital enzyme in the O-glycosylation pathway, responsible for transferring glucose to hydroxylysine residues on proteins. Its localization in the ER and Golgi apparatus facilitates efficient glycosylation, which is essential for the proper function of glycoproteins. Mutations in B3GLCT can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in maintaining cellular and systemic health.
