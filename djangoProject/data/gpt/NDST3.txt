Write a 100-350 word essay about human NDST3 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human NDST3 (N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferase 3) is part of the NDST enzyme family, playing a vital role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a significant glycosaminoglycan involved in various biological functions. NDST3 is responsible for two critical steps in HS biosynthesis: the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues and the subsequent sulfation of the glucosamine residues. These modifications are essential in forming the unique sulfation patterns within HS chains, which determine their interactions with a plethora of proteins.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, NDST3's activity significantly influences the structural diversity and functional specificity of HS. This diversity is crucial for HS's varied roles, including cell signaling, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and modulation of growth factor activities. The enzyme thus contributes to essential physiological processes and developmental pathways.

While direct links between NDST3 dysfunction and specific human diseases are not extensively documented, alterations in HS structure and function due to anomalies in NDST3 could theoretically contribute to various pathological conditions. Given HS's involvement in numerous cellular activities, NDST3 irregularities might play a role in developmental disorders, cancer progression, and impaired wound healing. Additionally, NDST3's role in HS biosynthesis implies potential significance in congenital disorders of glycosylation and other metabolic disorders involving glycosaminoglycans.

For more detailed insights into NDST3 and its role in HS biosynthesis, the following references are recommended:
