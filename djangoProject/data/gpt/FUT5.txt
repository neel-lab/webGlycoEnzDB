Write a 100-350 word essay about human FUT5: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human Fucosyltransferase 5 (FUT5), also known as GDP-Fucose Lactosamine α3/4-Fucosyltransferase, is a vital enzyme in the field of glycobiology, encoded by the FUT5 gene. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of specific fucose-containing structures in glycoproteins and glycolipids. The enzyme consists of 374 amino acids and is characterized by four potential N-glycosylation sites​​​​.

The expression of FUT5 is relatively low compared to other fucosyltransferases like FUT3 and FUT6, making its biological functions less clear. However, its importance is indicated by the presence of at least nine known SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in its coding region, suggesting a potential link to human diseases, although specific associations are still under investigation​​.

FUT5 transcripts are predominantly found in the liver, colon, testis, and brain, with minor amounts detectable in cultured melanoma cells, epithelial cancer cells, and leukocytes, including T-lymphocytes and HL-60 cells. These findings suggest a broad, yet specific, functional role of FUT5 in various tissues and cell types​​.

In terms of disease relevance, research has shown that FUT5 may play a role in cancer biology. For instance, studies using shRNA against FUT5 demonstrated its involvement in the regulation of sialyl Lewis x/a expression, a key player in cell adhesion and migration processes. This finding suggests that FUT5 could influence the binding of cancer cells to E-selectin, a crucial step in metastasis. Additionally, the expression of FUT5 is affected by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6, indicating a potential role in inflammatory responses​​.

For further detailed exploration of human FUT5, its functions, and implications in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:

Cameron et al., 1995 - Detailed analysis of FUT5 genomic structure and expression patterns​​.
Kunzendorf et al., 1994; Yago et al., 1993; Wittig et al., 1996; Mas et al., 1998 - Studies on FUT5 expression in various human tissues and cells, including cancer cells​​.
Padro et al., 2011a; Padro et al., 2011b - Research on the role of FUT5 in cancer cell migration and its regulation by cytokines​​.
These references provide a comprehensive insight into the enzymatic function, expression patterns, and potential clinical significance of human FUT5.
