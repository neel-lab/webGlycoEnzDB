Write a 100-350 word essay about human LARGE2
: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

LARGE2, also known as Glycosyltransferase-Like 1B (GYLTL1B), is a gene analogous to LARGE1 and is involved in crucial glycosylation processes in human biology. LARGE2 has been identified to catalyze similar glycosylation reactions as LARGE1 and functionally modifies alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG), albeit with different biochemical properties.

Functionally, LARGE2's role in the glycosylation of α-DG is critical. This process is essential for the proper functioning of α-DG, a significant component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in muscle cells. This complex connects the cytoskeleton of muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix. Glycosylation by LARGE2 enhances α-DG's ability to bind to laminin and other extracellular matrix components, crucial for muscle cell integrity and function.

LARGE2 participates in the post-translational modification pathway, specifically in the addition of glycan chains to α-DG. This modification is vital for the stability, localization, and function of α-DG in muscle cell membranes.

In terms of diseases, dysfunction or mutations in genes related to the glycosylation pathway, including LARGE2, can lead to a group of disorders known as dystroglycanopathies. These are characterized by a range of muscular and neurological abnormalities, presenting in various forms of muscular dystrophy, often coupled with brain and eye anomalies. The precise role of LARGE2 in these conditions and its clinical implications are areas of active research.

For more detailed information on LARGE2, the following scientific references are recommended:
