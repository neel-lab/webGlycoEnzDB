Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST6GALNAC2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST6GALNAC2 (ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays an essential role in the glycosylation process, specifically in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. ST6GALNAC2 is involved in the transfer of sialic acid to the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues of glycoconjugates, forming alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid structures.

Primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, ST6GALNAC2 facilitates the addition of sialic acid to GalNAc on oligosaccharides, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of glycoproteins and glycolipids. These sialylated glycoconjugates are involved in various biological functions, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and signal transduction.

The activity of ST6GALNAC2 is significant in the context of cancer. Altered expression of ST6GALNAC2 has been observed in various tumor types and is thought to be associated with cancer progression and metastasis. Changes in sialylation patterns can influence tumor cell adhesion, migration, and interactions with the immune system. For instance, aberrant sialylation may contribute to tumor cells' ability to evade immune surveillance.

While the direct links between ST6GALNAC2 dysfunction and specific diseases are not extensively documented, the enzyme's role in glycosylation suggests its potential involvement in pathological processes, particularly in oncogenesis and immune-related disorders.

For more detailed information on ST6GALNAC2, its function, and its role in disease, the following key references are recommended:
