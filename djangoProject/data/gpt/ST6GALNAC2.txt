### Function
Human ST6GALNAC2, or ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 2, is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues on glycoproteins. Specifically, ST6GALNAC2 transfers sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage to O-linked GalNAc, similar to its homolog ST6GALNAC1. This sialylation is critical for the formation of sialylated glycoproteins involved in cell-cell communication, immune responses, and protein stability.

### Reaction Pathways
ST6GALNAC2 functions within the glycosylation pathway, particularly in the sialylation of O-linked glycans. The enzyme transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid, the donor molecule, to the GalNAc residues on glycoproteins, resulting in the formation of sialyl-T antigens. These sialylated structures play important roles in cellular interactions, influencing processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune recognition. ST6GALNAC2’s activity is essential for producing functional glycoproteins that are crucial for normal cellular processes.

### Location
ST6GALNAC2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, an organelle central to the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, ST6GALNAC2 sialylates glycoproteins during their processing, ensuring that they are properly modified before being transported to the cell surface or secreted. This Golgi localization is vital for the enzyme’s role in the post-translational modification of proteins, contributing to their proper function and stability.

### Diseases
Alterations in ST6GALNAC2 expression or function have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. Abnormal sialylation patterns driven by ST6GALNAC2 can contribute to tumor progression by enhancing cancer cell invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion. The enzyme's activity is also associated with the development of specific carbohydrate antigens that are often overexpressed in cancer cells, serving as biomarkers for diagnosis and targets for therapy. Understanding the role of ST6GALNAC2 is important for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating sialylation in cancer and other diseases linked to glycosylation abnormalities.
