Human CHST11, known as Carbohydrate (Chondroitin 4) Sulfotransferase 11, is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS), a key component of the extracellular matrix found in various connective tissues. CHST11 specifically catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in chondroitin, contributing to the formation of sulfated CS. This sulfation process is essential for the biological functions of CS, including its interaction with various proteins and its role in cell signaling and adhesion.

The activity of CHST11 is critical in various physiological processes, particularly in the development and maintenance of cartilage. Proper sulfation of CS by CHST11 influences cartilage resilience and elasticity, which are important for joint function and overall skeletal integrity. Moreover, CHST11 is involved in growth factor signaling during cartilage morphogenesis, highlighting its significance in skeletal development.

Abnormalities in CHST11 function or expression can lead to pathological conditions. For example, dysregulated chondroitin sulfation by CHST11 has been implicated in disorders such as Costello syndrome, where altered CS sulfation interferes with oncogenic HRAS signaling. This suggests that CHST11's enzymatic activity is not only important for normal tissue development but also plays a role in disease mechanisms, particularly in conditions involving abnormal cell signaling and growth.

For more detailed information on human CHST11, the following key references are recommended:

Yamauchi et al. (2000), Okuda et al. (2000), and Hiraoka et al. (2000): Discuss the structure and function of CHST11 in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis.
Kl√ºppel et al. (2012) and Mikami et al. (2003): Provide insights into the role of CHST11 in developmental processes and its association with human diseases, including its impact on signaling pathways in conditions like Costello syndrome.
Understanding the role of CHST11 in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis is crucial for advancing knowledge in connective tissue pathology, developmental biology, and potential therapeutic interventions for related disorders.
