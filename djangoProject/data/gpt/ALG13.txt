### Function
Human ALG13 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 13) is a crucial enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. It functions as a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) transferase, responsible for adding the initial N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. ALG13 forms a heterodimeric complex with ALG14, and together they catalyze one of the earliest steps in the assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor necessary for protein glycosylation.
### Reaction Pathways
The reaction pathway of ALG13 involves the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-PP-dolichol. This step is essential for forming GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, which serves as a foundational structure for further elongation by additional glycosyltransferases. The ALG13/ALG14 complex ensures the proper assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane before it is flipped into the lumen for further processing.

### Location
ALG13 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite being a soluble cytosolic protein, ALG13 requires interaction with the membrane-bound ALG14 for its stability and function. The ALG13/ALG14 complex anchors to the ER membrane, allowing efficient access to its substrates and participation in the glycosylation pathway. This localization is critical for the enzyme's role in initiating the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG13 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ir (ALG13-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG13-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, hypotonia, and other systemic issues. The identification of pathogenic mutations, such as a missense mutation altering lysine 94 to glutamic acid, highlights the enzyme's importance in maintaining proper glycosylation processes.

In summary, human ALG13 is an essential enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating the addition of GlcNAc residues necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its ER localization and interaction with ALG14 underscore its critical role in cellular function, and mutations in ALG13 can lead to significant congenital disorders, emphasizing the enzyme's importance in human health.
