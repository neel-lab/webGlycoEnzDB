### Function
Human ST8SIA3, or alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 3, is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acid polymers, specifically catalyzing the addition of sialic acid residues in an alpha-2,8 linkage to target glycoproteins and glycolipids. While less studied than other members of the sialyltransferase family, ST8SIA3 is thought to contribute to the sialylation processes that are important for cell-cell interactions, neural development, and the modulation of immune responses.

### Reaction Pathways
ST8SIA3 functions in the sialylation pathway, where it transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to form polysialic acid chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzymatic activity is crucial for creating polysialylated structures, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and signaling. The specific substrates and precise roles of ST8SIA3 are still being explored, but its activity is essential for the proper function of sialylated molecules in the body.

### Location
ST8SIA3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the organelle responsible for the post-translational modification of proteins and lipids. In the Golgi, ST8SIA3 adds sialic acid residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids as they are processed and prepared for transport to their final destinations. This Golgi localization is critical for ensuring that sialylation occurs correctly, allowing the modified proteins and lipids to perform their roles in cellular communication and function.

### Diseases
Although the specific diseases directly associated with ST8SIA3 are not well-documented, disruptions in its function could contribute to disorders related to abnormal sialylation. Given its role in the sialylation of neural and immune molecules, altered ST8SIA3 activity could potentially impact neurodevelopmental disorders and immune system dysfunctions. In addition, since other sialyltransferases are implicated in cancer, ST8SIA3 may also play a role in tumor progression by influencing cell adhesion and migration. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of ST8SIA3 in health and disease.
