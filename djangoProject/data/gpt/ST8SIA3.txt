Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST8SIA3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST8SIA3 (ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 3) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of complex gangliosides, which are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids crucial for various cellular functions. ST8SIA3 specifically catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to existing sialylated glycoconjugates, contributing to the formation of polysialic acid (PSA) chains in gangliosides.

Predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, ST8SIA3 is responsible for the elongation of PSA chains, a process essential for the proper functioning of gangliosides in the plasma membrane. These elongated PSA chains are important in cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and cellular differentiation, particularly in the nervous system where they influence neural development, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration.

The role of ST8SIA3 is significant in neurobiology. Abnormalities in its activity can affect neural cell adhesion and migration, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders. Polysialylation, mediated by ST8SIA3, is crucial during brain development, and dysregulation of this process has been linked to conditions such as schizophrenia and autism.

In addition to its role in the nervous system, ST8SIA3 is also implicated in cancer biology. Altered ganglioside profiles, including changes in polysialylated structures due to ST8SIA3 activity, can influence tumor growth, metastasis, and interactions with the immune system.

For more detailed information on ST8SIA3, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
