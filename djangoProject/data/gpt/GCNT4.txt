### Function
Human GCNT4, or glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 4, is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of branched glycan structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids. GCNT4 catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to galactose-containing glycan chains, leading to the formation of complex branched structures. These glycans are important for various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, signaling, and the stabilization of glycoproteins.

### Reaction Pathways
GCNT4 functions within the glycosylation pathway, specifically contributing to the creation of branched N-acetyllactosamine structures. By adding GlcNAc to existing glycan chains, GCNT4 plays a critical role in the maturation of complex glycoproteins and glycolipids. These branched glycans are integral to cell surface molecules involved in immune recognition, intercellular communication, and the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

### Location
GCNT4 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular organelle responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, GCNT4 ensures that proteins and lipids are properly glycosylated, allowing them to function correctly once they reach their final destinations. The strategic localization of GCNT4 in the Golgi is crucial for its role in the sequential steps of glycan synthesis and modification.

### Diseases
Dysregulation of GCNT4 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. Abnormal expression of GCNT4 can lead to altered glycosylation patterns on cell surface proteins, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis by affecting cell adhesion and immune evasion. Additionally, variations in GCNT4 activity have been associated with certain neurological disorders, where glycan structures are critical for proper brain function. The enzyme's role in glycosylation makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at correcting abnormal glycan patterns in disease states.
