Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human STT3A. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human STT3A is an essential enzyme that functions as a catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is responsible for the N-glycosylation of proteins. STT3A specifically catalyzes the transfer of a pre-assembled oligosaccharide (a sugar chain) from a lipid-linked donor molecule to the asparagine residue of nascent polypeptides. This process is crucial for the proper folding, stability, and function of many proteins.

### Reaction Pathways
STT3A operates within the N-glycosylation pathway, where it facilitates the transfer of a glycan (usually a 14-sugar oligosaccharide) from a lipid carrier, dolichol phosphate, to an asparagine residue within a consensus sequence (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) on the growing polypeptide chain. This reaction occurs co-translationally, meaning it takes place as the protein is being synthesized by the ribosome and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N-glycosylation is critical for protein quality control and trafficking within the cell.

### Location
STT3A is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it is part of the OST complex. The ER is the site of protein synthesis, folding, and post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. STT3A's presence in the ER membrane ensures that newly synthesized proteins are properly glycosylated as they enter the ER lumen, which is crucial for their subsequent folding and function.

### Diseases
Mutations or defects in the STT3A gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG-I, a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycoprotein biosynthesis. These disorders can result in a wide range of symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, immune system deficiencies, and gastrointestinal problems. The severity of the disease can vary depending on the specific mutation within the STT3A gene. Understanding the role of STT3A in N-glycosylation is critical for diagnosing and developing treatments for these glycosylation-related disorders.
