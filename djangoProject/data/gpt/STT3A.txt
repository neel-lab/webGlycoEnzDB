Write a 100-350 word essay about human STT3A: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human STT3A (STT3, subunit A of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex) is an integral membrane protein that plays a vital role in the process of N-linked glycosylation, a fundamental post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. STT3A, as a part of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, is responsible for the transfer of a pre-assembled oligosaccharide from a lipid donor to specific asparagine residues in nascent polypeptides.

Located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), STT3A's primary function is to catalyze the co-translational attachment of glycans to asparagine residues within the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except proline). This glycosylation process is crucial for proper protein folding, stability, and function. STT3A is particularly important for the glycosylation of proteins early in their synthesis, contributing to protein quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways.

Dysfunction or mutations in the STT3A gene can lead to various diseases due to its critical role in protein glycosylation. For instance, congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), a group of rare metabolic disorders, can result from defects in the STT3A gene. These disorders are characterized by a wide range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and multi-organ dysfunction, reflecting the importance of N-linked glycosylation in numerous biological processes.

For more detailed information on STT3A, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
