Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGU: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGU (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class U) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are complex glycolipids that serve to attach a variety of proteins to the cell surface, playing key roles in numerous cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

PIGU is involved in the late stages of the GPI anchor assembly pathway. Specifically, it is part of the GPI transamidase complex that catalyzes the attachment of the GPI anchor to the C-terminus of target proteins. This step is critical for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane, thereby influencing their localization, stability, and function.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGU works in concert with other components of the GPI transamidase complex to ensure the efficient and accurate addition of GPI anchors to proteins. This process is vital for the proper functioning of GPI-anchored proteins, which include enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules critical for various biological functions.

While specific diseases directly linked to PIGU dysfunction are not widely documented, impairments in GPI anchor biosynthesis can lead to GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). These rare genetic disorders may present with symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays, highlighting the importance of GPI-anchored proteins in neural development and physiological processes.

For more information on PIGU and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
