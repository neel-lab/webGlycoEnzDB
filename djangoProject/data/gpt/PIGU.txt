### Function
Human PIGU, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class U, is an enzyme involved in the final steps of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are essential for attaching certain proteins to the cell membrane, where they play crucial roles in signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGU is a component of the GPI transamidase complex, which is responsible for attaching the GPI anchor to proteins, thereby ensuring their proper localization and function on the cell surface.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGU functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, specifically in the GPI transamidation process. As part of the GPI transamidase complex, PIGU helps facilitate the transfer of the preassembled GPI anchor to the carboxyl terminus of newly synthesized proteins, following the cleavage of the signal peptide. This step is critical for the correct attachment of GPI anchors to proteins, which is essential for their stable anchoring to the cell membrane and their involvement in various cellular functions.

### Location
PIGU is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it operates as part of the GPI transamidase complex. The ER is the cellular organelle where protein synthesis and initial post-translational modifications occur, making it the ideal location for PIGU to perform its role in GPI anchor attachment. The enzyme’s presence in the ER ensures that GPI-anchored proteins are correctly processed and prepared for transport to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGU gene have been linked to inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. These conditions arise from defective GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to the mislocalization and malfunction of GPI-anchored proteins. The loss of proper GPI anchoring disrupts critical cellular processes, contributing to the clinical manifestations of IGDs. Understanding PIGU’s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for diagnosing and developing potential treatments for these disorders.
