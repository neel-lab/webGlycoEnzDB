### Function
Human PAPSS2, or 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 2, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor used in various sulfation reactions. PAPSS2 catalyzes the conversion of ATP and inorganic sulfate into PAPS through a two-step reaction. This enzyme is vital for the sulfation of a wide range of molecules, including hormones, drugs, glycosaminoglycans, and proteins, which is essential for their biological activity, stability, and solubility.

### Reaction Pathways
PAPSS2 is involved in the sulfate activation pathway. The enzyme first converts ATP into adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) by transferring a sulfate group to ATP. In the second step, PAPSS2 phosphorylates APS using another ATP molecule to produce PAPS. PAPS then serves as a sulfate donor for sulfotransferase enzymes, which transfer sulfate groups to target molecules. This sulfation process is critical for various physiological processes, including detoxification, hormone regulation, and the formation of extracellular matrix components like cartilage.

### Location
PAPSS2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it generates PAPS for use in sulfation reactions throughout the cell. Its presence in the cytoplasm allows PAPSS2 to provide PAPS to sulfotransferases located in both the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus. This localization ensures that the cell has a sufficient supply of PAPS to meet the demands of various sulfation processes.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PAPSS2 gene are associated with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Pakistani type (SEMD-PA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, including short stature, joint deformities, and early-onset osteoarthritis. This condition arises due to defective sulfation of proteoglycans in cartilage, leading to impaired cartilage formation and bone development. Additionally, altered PAPSS2 activity may impact the sulfation of hormones like estrogen, potentially contributing to hormonal imbalances. Understanding PAPSS2's function is crucial for diagnosing and developing treatments for conditions related to abnormal sulfation.
