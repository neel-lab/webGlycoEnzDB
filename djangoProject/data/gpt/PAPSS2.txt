Write a 100-350 word essay about human PAPSS2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PAPSS2 (3'-Phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate Synthase 2) is an enzyme essential for the sulfation of various biological molecules. Like its paralog PAPSS1, PAPSS2 is involved in the biosynthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is a critical sulfate donor in numerous sulfation reactions. These reactions are central to the metabolism of hormones, detoxification processes, and the modification of extracellular matrix components such as glycosaminoglycans.

PAPSS2 is found predominantly in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transfer of sulfate groups to various substrates. This sulfation process is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of proteoglycans, which play vital roles in connective tissues, and for the metabolism of steroids and other small molecules.

Mutations in the PAPSS2 gene have been directly linked to certain inherited skeletal disorders. Notably, PAPSS2 deficiency causes a form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), leading to skeletal abnormalities due to impaired sulfation of cartilage proteoglycans. This condition is characterized by short stature, bone deformities, and joint problems. The sulfation impairment affects the strength and resilience of cartilage and bone, highlighting the enzyme's importance in skeletal development.
