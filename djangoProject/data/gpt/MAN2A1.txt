MAN2A1, also known as Golgi alpha-mannosidase II, is a crucial enzyme in the processing of N-linked glycans in human cells. Encoded by the MAN2A1 gene, this enzyme plays a pivotal role in the maturation of glycoproteins within the Golgi apparatus.

MAN2A1's primary function is to cleave alpha-mannose residues from the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. This process is a key step in the transformation of high-mannose oligosaccharides into complex or hybrid N-linked glycans. By trimming mannose residues, MAN2A1 ensures that glycoproteins are correctly processed, allowing them to attain their final structure and functionality. This enzymatic activity is vital for various cellular processes, including protein quality control, signaling, and trafficking.

MAN2A1 participates in the N-linked glycan processing pathway, which is crucial for the maturation of newly synthesized glycoproteins. In the Golgi apparatus, MAN2A1, along with other enzymes, contributes to the sequential trimming of mannose residues, enabling glycoproteins to undergo subsequent processing steps that are essential for their proper function and localization.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MAN2A1 plays a significant role in the late stages of glycoprotein processing. Its position in the Golgi apparatus is strategic for the formation of mature glycoproteins, which are essential for normal cell function and communication.

While specific diseases directly associated with MAN2A1 mutations are not widely reported, general dysfunctions in glycan processing can lead to various conditions, including developmental disorders and immune system dysfunctions.

For more detailed information on MAN2A1, the following key scientific references are recommended:
