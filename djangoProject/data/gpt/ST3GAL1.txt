### Function
Human ST3GAL1, or ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Specifically, it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from the donor molecule CMP-sialic acid to galactose residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids, forming sialylated structures. This sialylation process is essential for determining the stability, recognition, and function of these molecules in various biological processes, including cell-cell communication and immune responses.

### Reaction Pathways
ST3GAL1 operates in the sialylation pathway, where it catalyzes the formation of sialylated glycan structures. This enzyme transfers sialic acid in an alpha-2,3 linkage to the terminal galactose on O-linked glycans, which are typically found on glycoproteins, including mucins. The products of this sialylation process are critical for modulating the biological properties of glycoproteins and glycolipids, affecting processes like cell adhesion, signal transduction, and protection against enzymatic degradation.

### Location
ST3GAL1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular organelle responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, ST3GAL1 participates in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids by adding sialic acid residues. This strategic localization ensures that sialylation occurs at the appropriate stage of protein and lipid processing, contributing to the formation of functional and stable glycoproteins and glycolipids.

### Diseases
Alterations in the function or expression of ST3GAL1 have been associated with various diseases, particularly cancer. Aberrant sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL1 can affect tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Overexpression of ST3GAL1 has been observed in certain cancers, leading to increased sialylation of cell surface glycoproteins, which can promote tumor cell invasion and resistance to apoptosis. Understanding the role of ST3GAL1 in these processes is critical for developing targeted therapies for cancers and other diseases related to abnormal glycosylation.
