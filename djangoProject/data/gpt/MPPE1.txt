### Function
Human MPPE1, or metallophosphoesterase 1, is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. MPPE1 specifically removes ethanolamine phosphate from the second mannose residue of GPI anchors, a crucial step in the maturation and proper functioning of these anchored proteins. GPI-anchored proteins play key roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response.

### Reaction Pathways
MPPE1 functions within the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway. During the processing of GPI-anchored proteins, MPPE1 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of ethanolamine phosphate from the second mannose of the GPI anchor. This modification is necessary for the subsequent remodeling and maturation of the GPI anchor, which ensures the correct localization and functionality of GPI-anchored proteins at the cell surface. Proper GPI-anchor processing is essential for the stability and activity of these proteins in the membrane.

### Location
MPPE1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the maturation of GPI-anchored proteins. These cellular organelles are crucial for protein synthesis, modification, and trafficking. The localization of MPPE1 within the ER and Golgi ensures that GPI-anchored proteins undergo necessary modifications before being transported to the cell surface, where they perform their biological functions.

### Diseases
Dysfunction or mutations in the MPPE1 gene could potentially disrupt the proper maturation of GPI-anchored proteins, leading to a range of cellular dysfunctions. Although specific diseases directly linked to MPPE1 mutations have not been well-characterized, defects in GPI-anchor biosynthesis and processing are associated with various inherited disorders, known as GPI-anchor deficiencies. These conditions can lead to neurological problems, developmental delays, and other systemic issues. Further research into MPPE1's role may provide insights into its involvement in these disorders and its potential as a therapeutic target for related conditions.
