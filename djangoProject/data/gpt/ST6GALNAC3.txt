Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST6GALNAC3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST6GALNAC3 (ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the process of glycosylation, particularly in sialylation, which is the addition of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This specific enzyme is involved in the transfer of sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, forming alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid structures on glycoconjugates.

Located primarily in the Golgi apparatus, ST6GALNAC3 functions to add sialic acid to the GalNAc residues of oligosaccharides on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of these molecules, as it influences their stability, activity, and interactions with other cellular components. Sialylated glycoconjugates are involved in a range of biological processes including cell-cell communication, immune response, and signal transduction.

The role of ST6GALNAC3 is significant in the context of cancer biology. Altered expression of ST6GALNAC3 has been observed in certain types of cancers, suggesting its potential involvement in cancer progression and metastasis. Abnormal sialylation patterns, which can result from changes in ST6GALNAC3 expression, may impact tumor cell behavior, including cell adhesion, migration, and interactions with the immune system. Moreover, these changes in glycosylation patterns can influence the development and progression of tumors.

While direct links between specific diseases and mutations in the ST6GALNAC3 gene are not extensively documented, its role in the glycosylation process suggests its potential involvement in various disorders, particularly those related to oncogenesis and immune function.

For more detailed information on ST6GALNAC3, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
