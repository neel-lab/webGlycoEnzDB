Write a 100-350 word essay about human POMT2 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human POMT2 (Protein O-Mannosyltransferase 2) works closely with POMT1 in the post-translational modification of proteins, specifically in the O-mannosylation of the dystroglycan complex. This complex is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers and for the interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix.

Located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), POMT2 catalyzes the transfer of mannose to serine or threonine residues on dystroglycan proteins. This process is essential for the proper functioning of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG), a key component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. α-DG binds to laminin in the extracellular matrix, a critical interaction for muscle function and stability.

Mutations in the POMT2 gene can lead to a range of muscular dystrophies known as dystroglycanopathies, characterized by a spectrum of symptoms from mild to severe muscular dystrophy, intellectual disability, and brain and eye malformations. One of the most severe dystroglycanopathies associated with POMT2 mutations is Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS), a rare congenital muscular dystrophy that also involves significant brain and ocular abnormalities.

For more detailed information on POMT2 and its role in health and disease, the following key references are recommended:

These references provide insights into the biochemical properties of POMT2, its significance in the O-mannosylation process, particularly concerning dystroglycan, and the implications of its dysfunction in conditions such as Walker-Warburg Syndrome and other dystroglycanopathies.
