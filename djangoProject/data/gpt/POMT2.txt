### Function
Human POMT2, or protein O-mannosyltransferase 2, is an enzyme that is essential for the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a protein critical for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells and proper nervous system function. POMT2 works in tandem with POMT1 to catalyze the transfer of mannose from dolichol-phosphate-mannose to serine or threonine residues on alpha-dystroglycan. This mannosylation step is crucial for initiating the glycosylation process, which is vital for the protein's function in cell-matrix interactions.

### Reaction Pathways
POMT2 operates within the O-mannosylation glycosylation pathway. Together with POMT1, it forms a complex that catalyzes the initial step of O-mannosylation, where a mannose molecule is attached to specific serine or threonine residues on alpha-dystroglycan. This modification is the first in a series of glycosylation steps that allow alpha-dystroglycan to bind effectively to extracellular matrix proteins like laminin. Proper glycosylation facilitated by POMT2 is essential for the structural stability of muscle tissues and the normal development of the nervous system.

### Location
POMT2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it functions alongside POMT1 to initiate the glycosylation of proteins. The ER provides the optimal environment for these enzymes to access newly synthesized proteins and perform the mannosylation step necessary for subsequent glycosylation modifications. This ER localization is critical for ensuring that alpha-dystroglycan is properly glycosylated before it moves through the Golgi apparatus for further processing and eventual transport to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the POMT2 gene are associated with several forms of congenital muscular dystrophies, including Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). These disorders are characterized by severe muscle weakness, brain malformations, and, in some cases, eye abnormalities. The diseases result from impaired glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, leading to defective cell-matrix interactions and subsequent tissue instability. Understanding POMT2â€™s role is crucial for diagnosing these conditions and developing therapeutic strategies to address the underlying glycosylation defects.
