Write a 100-350 word essay about human EDEM2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human EDEM2 (ER Degradation Enhancing α-Mannosidase Like Protein 2) is an essential component of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway, a critical cellular mechanism for maintaining protein homeostasis. EDEM2, like its homolog EDEM1, is involved in the identification and disposal of misfolded glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Function and Reaction Pathways:
EDEM2 functions by recognizing and binding to misfolded glycoproteins in the ER, particularly targeting those with mannose residues. This recognition is crucial for the ERAD pathway, as it marks these misfolded proteins for degradation. EDEM2 accelerates their removal from the ER and directs them towards the proteasome, where they are degraded. This process is vital in preventing the accumulation of defective proteins, which can disrupt cellular functions and lead to various diseases.

Location:
EDEM2 is located in the ER, the primary site for protein folding and quality control. Its presence here is strategic for its role in monitoring the proper folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins and targeting aberrant proteins for degradation.

Diseases:
Impairments in the ERAD pathway, including dysfunction of EDEM2, can lead to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, resulting in ER stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This can contribute to a range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders (like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease), metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), and certain cancers. EDEM2's role in viral infections has also been noted, with some viruses potentially exploiting the ERAD pathway to enhance their replication.

Key References:
For more detailed information on EDEM2, the following references are recommended:
