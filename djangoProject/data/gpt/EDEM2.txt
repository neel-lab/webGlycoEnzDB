### Function

Human EDEM2 (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein 2) is primarily involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. EDEM2 plays a critical role in identifying and targeting misfolded glycoproteins for degradation. It does so by trimming mannose residues from misfolded glycoproteins, marking them for recognition and removal by the ERAD system. This mannose trimming is crucial for maintaining protein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ensuring that only properly folded proteins proceed through the secretory pathway .

### Reaction Pathways

EDEM2 participates in the demannosylation process within the ER. It specifically converts Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8BGlcNAc2 by cleaving the central α1,2-linked mannose residue. This step is essential in the glycoprotein quality control system, as it prepares the misfolded glycoproteins for retrotranslocation into the cytosol where they are subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Unlike some other mannosidases, EDEM2 does not process glycoproteins for maturation but instead targets them for degradation .

### Location

EDEM2 is localized exclusively within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This localization is critical for its role in the ERAD pathway, as the ER is the site where nascent glycoproteins are folded and modified. The presence of EDEM2 in the ER allows it to efficiently interact with newly synthesized glycoproteins and identify those that are misfolded or improperly assembled  .

### Diseases

While specific mutations in EDEM2 have not been directly linked to human diseases, dysfunction in the ERAD pathway, where EDEM2 is a key player, can contribute to various disorders. For instance, ineffective ERAD can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, a condition associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Additionally, ER stress and impaired protein degradation are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and certain cancers. Thus, while EDEM2 itself may not be directly mutated, its functional impairment can have significant downstream effects on cellular health and disease  .

In conclusion, EDEM2 is a crucial enzyme in the ERAD pathway, responsible for mannose trimming of misfolded glycoproteins within the ER. Its proper function ensures protein quality control, and disruptions in this process are associated with various diseases, highlighting the importance of EDEM2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
