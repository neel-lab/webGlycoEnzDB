Write a 100-350 word essay about human GAL3ST2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.



involved in the sulfation of galactosyl-containing lipids and glycoproteins. This enzyme adds a sulfate group to the 3-position of the galactose moiety in these molecules, which is a crucial modification for various biological processes.

GAL3ST2, along with other members of the Gal3ST family (including GAL3ST1, GAL3ST3, and GAL3ST4), shares a type II transmembrane topology. Human GAL3ST2 consists of 398 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the Gal3ST family members exhibit a moderate degree of identity to each other, ranging between 30% and 39%. The precise functions of GAL3ST2, as well as its specific role in cellular pathways, are not as extensively studied as those of GAL3ST1 (GalCer sulfotransferase), which has been more thoroughly researched for its role in myelin formation and neurological function.

The sulfation process catalyzed by GAL3ST2 is essential for modifying the properties of galactosyl-containing molecules, impacting their function in cell signaling, molecular recognition, and possibly in the formation of the extracellular matrix. Disruption or alterations in the function of sulfotransferases like GAL3ST2 could potentially impact these processes, although specific diseases directly linked to GAL3ST2 mutations or deficiencies are not well-documented.

For more detailed information about human GAL3ST2 and its functions, the following key references can be consulted:

Eckhardt, M., et al. (2002) - Study on the importance of N-glycosylation in Gal3ST enzyme activity.
Yaghootfam, A., et al. (2007) - Research on murine GalCer sulfotransferase, closely related to human GAL3ST2.
El-Fasakhany, F.M., et al. (2001); Honke, K., et al. (2001); Seko, A., et al. (2001); Suzuki, A., et al. (2001) - Studies providing insight into the structure and characteristics of human Gal3ST members, including GAL3ST2​​.
These references should offer a comprehensive overview of the enzymatic function, biological significance, and potential clinical implications of human GAL3ST2.
