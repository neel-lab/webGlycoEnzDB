Human HS6ST2: Function, Pathways, Location, and Disease Associations

Heparan-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (HS6ST2) is a key enzyme in human biochemistry, involved in the modification of heparan sulfate, a complex glycosaminoglycan. HS6ST2 plays a crucial role in the sulfation of heparan sulfate, which significantly affects its interaction with various proteins and, consequently, numerous biological processes.

Functionally, HS6ST2 catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 6-O position of the glucosamine residue in heparan sulfate. This specific sulfation is vital for determining the biological activity of heparan sulfate, impacting processes such as cell signaling, growth factor binding, and extracellular matrix formation. Notably, HS6ST2 has a distinct substrate preference compared to its isoforms, favoring sulfation at specific sites within the heparan sulfate chain. This precision in modification underlines the enzyme's role in fine-tuning the structural and functional properties of heparan sulfate.

HS6ST2 participates in the biosynthesis and remodeling pathway of heparan sulfate, primarily within the Golgi apparatus, where it adds sulfate groups to newly synthesized heparan sulfate chains. This sulfation is crucial for the final maturation of heparan sulfate, influencing its binding affinity and specificity towards various biological molecules.

Regarding disease associations, alterations in HS6ST2 activity can potentially lead to disorders related to abnormal heparan sulfate structure and function. This can have wide-ranging effects, including developmental abnormalities, impaired wound healing, and dysregulated cell signaling, which might contribute to cancer progression or other pathological conditions.
