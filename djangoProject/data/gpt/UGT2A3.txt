Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT2A3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT2A3 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member A3) is an enzyme belonging to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, which plays a significant role in the body's detoxification processes. UGT2A3 is involved in the glucuronidation pathway, a critical phase II metabolic reaction. This pathway involves the conjugation of glucuronic acid to various compounds, including drugs, environmental toxins, and endogenous substances, thereby enhancing their water solubility and facilitating their excretion from the body.

UGT2A3, like some other members of the UGT2 family, is predominantly expressed in extrahepatic tissues, especially in the olfactory epithelium. This unique expression pattern suggests its role in the detoxification of airborne chemicals and odorants. By metabolizing these substances in the nasal passages, UGT2A3 contributes to protecting the olfactory system from potential damage caused by toxic environmental agents.

Given its localization in olfactory tissues, dysfunction or genetic variations in UGT2A3 could potentially impact the body's ability to process and eliminate airborne chemicals, which might lead to olfactory disorders or increased susceptibility to environmental toxins. This could have implications for the sense of smell and overall nasal health.

Moreover, the role of UGT2A3 in the metabolism of certain drugs and endogenous compounds underscores its importance in pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine. Variations in UGT2A3 activity can influence individual responses to medications, affecting drug efficacy and safety.

For more detailed information on UGT2A3, its function, and related diseases, the following references are recommended:
