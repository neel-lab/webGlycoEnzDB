Write a 100-350 word essay about human GMPPB: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human GMPPB, or GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B, is a vital component of the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPP) complex, playing a crucial role in nucleotide sugar metabolism.

Function
GMPPB is responsible for the catalytic reaction in the synthesis of GDP-mannose, an essential sugar nucleotide used in the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. GDP-mannose serves as a mannose donor in various glycosylation processes, which are fundamental for proper cell function, including protein folding, cell signaling, and immune response.

Reaction Pathways
GMPPB, along with GMPPA, participates in the conversion of mannose-1-phosphate and GTP into GDP-mannose. This reaction is an important step in the glycosylation pathway, particularly for the formation of N-linked and O-linked glycoproteins, as well as glycolipids. Glycoconjugates formed through these pathways play essential roles in numerous biological processes, such as cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and cell signaling.

Location
The precise cellular localization of human GMPPB is not explicitly stated in my knowledge source. However, based on its function in nucleotide sugar metabolism, GMPPB is likely located in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the synthesis of GDP-mannose.

Related Diseases
Disruptions in the function of GMPPB can potentially lead to disorders related to glycosylation. Abnormalities in glycosylation pathways can result in a range of diseases, including congenital disorders of glycosylation, which affect multiple organ systems and exhibit diverse clinical manifestations.
