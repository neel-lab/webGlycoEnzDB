Write a 100-350 word essay about human GNPTG: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human GNPTG, encoding the gamma subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, is crucial in the lysosomal enzyme targeting pathway.

Function
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, for which GNPTG codes the gamma subunit, plays a vital role in adding a mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) recognition marker to lysosomal enzymes. This marker is essential for the correct trafficking of these enzymes to the lysosomes. The absence or malfunctioning of this marker leads to misdirection of lysosomal enzymes and consequent lysosomal storage disorders.

Reaction Pathways
GNPTG is part of the enzymatic complex involved in the post-translational modification of lysosomal enzymes. The complex catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate to mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes, marking them for transport to lysosomes. This process is essential for maintaining proper lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis.

Location
GNPTG, as a part of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex, is located in the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, it participates in the critical step of tagging lysosomal enzymes with the Man-6-P marker for their correct delivery to lysosomes.

Related Diseases
Mutations in the GNPTG gene are associated with mucolipidosis type III gamma (ML III gamma, OMIM: 252605). This lysosomal storage disorder is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, joint stiffness, and developmental delays, among other symptoms. It results from impaired targeting of lysosomal enzymes due to defective Man-6-P marker formation.
