Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST8SIA2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST8SIA2 (ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 2), also known as ST8Sia II or GD3 synthase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of gangliosides, a class of sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids. ST8SIA2 specifically catalyzes the addition of sialic acid to lactosylceramide, leading to the formation of gangliosides such as GD3, which are crucial components of cell membranes, particularly in the nervous system.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST8SIA2 is essential for the synthesis of b-series gangliosides, including GD3. Gangliosides are involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction. The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in the brain, where gangliosides play a role in neural development, synaptic function, and neuronal protection.

Abnormalities in ST8SIA2 function have been implicated in several neurological disorders. Altered ganglioside expression, potentially due to dysregulation of ST8SIA2, may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, variations in ST8SIA2 have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting a link between ganglioside biosynthesis and these psychiatric conditions.

Additionally, ST8SIA2 has been studied in the context of cancer, as altered ganglioside patterns, such as increased levels of GD3, have been observed in certain types of tumors. These changes can influence tumor growth, metastasis, and interactions with the immune system.

For more detailed information on ST8SIA2, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
