### Function
Human ST8SIA2, also known as alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 2, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of polysialic acid, a polymer of sialic acid molecules. ST8SIA2 catalyzes the addition of sialic acid residues to glycoproteins, particularly the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), forming long chains of polysialic acid. This modification is essential in the nervous system, where it regulates cell-cell interactions, neuronal plasticity, and neural development.

### Reaction Pathways
ST8SIA2 functions in the sialylation pathway, where it transfers sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to form alpha-2,8-linked polysialic acid chains on target glycoproteins, such as NCAM. Polysialylation of NCAM by ST8SIA2 reduces cell adhesion, allowing for greater cellular movement and flexibility. This process is vital during brain development, influencing processes such as neuron migration, axon pathfinding, and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for proper neural network formation and function.

### Location
ST8SIA2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the cellular organelle responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins. In the Golgi, ST8SIA2 adds polysialic acid chains to glycoproteins during their maturation. This localization ensures that the sialylation of glycoproteins like NCAM occurs efficiently, allowing these proteins to perform their roles in neural development and other cellular processes.

### Diseases
Mutations or altered expression of ST8SIA2 have been linked to several neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders. Abnormal polysialylation due to ST8SIA2 dysfunction can contribute to conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism, where disrupted neural development and plasticity play a role in the disease pathology. Additionally, changes in ST8SIA2 expression have been observed in certain cancers, particularly neuroblastoma, where polysialic acid can promote tumor cell migration and invasion. Understanding the function of ST8SIA2 is crucial for developing potential therapeutic strategies for these conditions, targeting the regulation of polysialylation.
