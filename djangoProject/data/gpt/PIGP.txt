### Function
Human PIGP, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class P, is an enzyme involved in the early stages of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are essential glycolipid structures that tether certain proteins to the cell membrane, playing key roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGP is a component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, responsible for the first step in GPI anchor biosynthesis—the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGP functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As part of the GPI-GnT complex, PIGP assists in catalyzing the initial transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol, forming GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol. This step is the first committed reaction in GPI anchor formation, which is followed by a series of modifications that ultimately produce a functional GPI anchor capable of attaching proteins to the cell membrane.

### Location
PIGP is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays its role in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGP to function effectively within the GPI-GnT complex, ensuring that the early stages of GPI anchor assembly proceed correctly. The proper localization of PIGP in the ER is crucial for the initial step of GPI anchor synthesis, which is essential for the subsequent attachment of proteins to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGP gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by a range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. These conditions result from defective GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to the improper function or mislocalization of GPI-anchored proteins. The absence or dysfunction of these proteins can disrupt critical cellular processes, contributing to the clinical manifestations of IGDs. Understanding PIGP’s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is important for diagnosing and developing therapeutic strategies for these disorders.
