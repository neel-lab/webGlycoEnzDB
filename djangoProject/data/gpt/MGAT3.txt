### Function
Human MGAT3, or N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, is an enzyme involved in the modification of N-linked glycoproteins. MGAT3 catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the core mannose residues of glycoproteins, forming a unique structure known as a bisecting GlcNAc. This modification plays a crucial role in regulating the branching of N-glycans, influencing the stability, folding, and biological function of glycoproteins. MGAT3's activity can impact cell signaling, adhesion, and immune responses.

### Reaction Pathways
MGAT3 functions within the N-glycosylation pathway, where it acts after the initial glycan processing steps in the medial-Golgi apparatus. Specifically, MGAT3 adds a GlcNAc residue to the beta-linked mannose of the core oligosaccharide structure on glycoproteins. This bisecting GlcNAc modification inhibits further branching of the glycan, which can alter the function and behavior of the glycoprotein. The presence of the bisecting GlcNAc is associated with changes in protein interactions, stability, and cellular signaling, making MGAT3 a key regulator in glycan-mediated processes.

### Location
MGAT3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, particularly in the medial-Golgi compartment, where it carries out its role in the glycosylation of proteins. The Golgi is a central organelle for the processing and modification of proteins before they are directed to their final destinations within the cell or secreted outside the cell. The enzyme's location in the Golgi is essential for its role in N-glycan processing, ensuring that glycoproteins are correctly modified and functional.

### Diseases
Alterations in MGAT3 activity have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. In cancer, changes in the expression of MGAT3 can lead to altered glycosylation patterns on cell surface proteins, influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Additionally, the bisecting GlcNAc structure created by MGAT3 is known to affect the function of immune receptors, potentially contributing to autoimmune diseases. Understanding MGAT3â€™s role in these processes is crucial for exploring therapeutic strategies targeting glycosylation in disease contexts, particularly in oncology and immunology.
