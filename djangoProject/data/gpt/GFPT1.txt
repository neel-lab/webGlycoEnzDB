Write a 100-350 word essay about human GFPT1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human GFPT1, also known as Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase 1, is an enzyme crucial in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.

Function
GFPT1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. It converts fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine into glucosamine-6-phosphate and glutamate. This pathway is essential for the production of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a critical substrate for protein glycosylation processes. Glycosylation is vital for numerous cellular functions, including protein folding, stability, and signaling.

Reaction Pathways
GFPT1 is central to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which integrates glucose metabolism with the production of glycosylated end products. The end products of this pathway, particularly UDP-GlcNAc, are used for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, influencing cellular functions ranging from cell surface signaling to intracellular protein trafficking.

Location
GFPT1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, and testis. Its regulation is influenced by factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and glucose levels. For instance, GFPT mRNA transcription is stimulated by EGF in certain human breast cancer cell lines but blocked by high glucose levels, indicating its involvement in response to cellular growth signals and metabolic status​​.

Related Diseases
Dysregulation of GFPT1 or the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway can contribute to several diseases. For example, high levels of activity in this pathway have been implicated in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This is because excess substrate flux through this pathway can lead to abnormal protein glycosylation and disrupt normal insulin signaling. Additionally, GFPT1 expression is induced by various conditions such as hypoxia, which has implications for diseases related to oxygen deprivation.
