### Function
Human GFPT1, or glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1, is a key enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). GFPT1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway, converting fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine into glucosamine-6-phosphate. This reaction is critical for producing UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a building block for glycosylation processes that modify proteins and lipids, influencing cellular signaling, metabolism, and the extracellular matrix.

### Reaction Pathways
GFPT1 operates within the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, a branch of glucose metabolism that diverges from glycolysis. After catalyzing the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate, this intermediate is further processed into UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc is then used in N- and O-linked glycosylation, as well as in the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans. This pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the availability of substrates for glycosylation, impacting protein folding, stability, and function, as well as cell signaling pathways that are essential for growth and differentiation.

### Location
GFPT1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm of cells, where it functions to regulate the flux of metabolites into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. This cytoplasmic localization allows GFPT1 to readily interact with glycolytic intermediates and ensure the continuous production of glucosamine-6-phosphate, which is vital for maintaining cellular glycosylation processes.

### Diseases
Mutations in the GFPT1 gene are associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), specifically a subtype known as GFPT1-related CMS. This genetic disorder is characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue due to impaired neuromuscular transmission. The mutation leads to deficient glycosylation of key proteins involved in neuromuscular junction function, resulting in the clinical symptoms of CMS. Additionally, dysregulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, in which GFPT1 plays a central role, has been linked to metabolic disorders such as diabetes, where altered glycosylation affects insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Understanding GFPT1â€™s function and regulation is therefore crucial in both neuromuscular and metabolic diseases.
