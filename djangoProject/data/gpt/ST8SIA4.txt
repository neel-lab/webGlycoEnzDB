Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST8SIA4: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST8SIA4 (ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 4), also known as polysialyltransferase (PST), is an enzyme integral to the biosynthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), a unique glycan modification. ST8SIA4 is responsible for catalyzing the addition of sialic acid residues to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), resulting in the formation of PSA-NCAM. This polysialylation alters NCAM's adhesive properties, which is crucial for cell-cell interactions, particularly in the nervous system.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST8SIA4 facilitates the elongation of PSA chains on NCAM. PSA-NCAM plays a vital role in neuronal development, including cell migration, axonal growth, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration. It modulates cell-cell adhesion properties, essential for the dynamic processes of the developing and adult nervous system.

Disruptions in ST8SIA4 function or expression have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Abnormal polysialylation patterns can affect neural development and functioning, potentially contributing to conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, changes in PSA-NCAM levels, mediated by ST8SIA4, have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, where they may impact neuronal connectivity and plasticity.

For more detailed information on ST8SIA4, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
