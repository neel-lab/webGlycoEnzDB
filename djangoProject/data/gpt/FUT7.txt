### Function

Human FUT7 (fucosyltransferase 7) is a crucial enzyme that catalyzes the addition of fucose in an α1,3-linkage to N-acetylglucosamine residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This activity is specifically involved in the synthesis of the sialyl Lewis X (sLex) antigen, a glycan structure that plays a significant role in mediating leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells during inflammation. FUT7 is the primary enzyme responsible for generating sLex in leukocytes, making it vital for the proper functioning of the immune system.

### Reaction Pathways

FUT7 operates in the fucosylation pathway, where it transfers fucose from GDP-fucose to sialylated type 2 lactosamine chains, forming the sLex antigen. This reaction is critical for creating ligands for selectins (E-, P-, and L-selectins), which mediate the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelial surface during the initial steps of inflammation and immune response. FUT7's role in synthesizing sLex makes it essential for leukocyte trafficking and the immune response to infection and injury.pdf】.

### Location

FUT7 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it carries out its function in the glycosylation process. The Golgi apparatus is the site where glycoproteins and glycolipids are processed and modified before being sent to their final destinations. FUT7's presence in the Golgi ensures that the sLex antigens are properly synthesized and presented on the cell surface, ready to interact with selectins during immune surveillance and inflammation.

### Diseases

Mutations or altered expression of FUT7 can lead to deficiencies in sLex expression, impairing leukocyte adhesion and migration. Such deficiencies can result in weakened immune responses and are associated with conditions like leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD II), which leads to recurrent bacterial infections and other immune-related issues. Additionally, aberrant FUT7 expression has been linked to inflammatory diseases and certain cancers, where altered glycosylation patterns can affect tumor progression and metastasis.pdf】.

In summary, FUT7 is a key enzyme in the fucosylation pathway, essential for synthesizing the sLex antigen involved in immune response. Its function in the Golgi apparatus and its role in disease underline its importance in human health.
