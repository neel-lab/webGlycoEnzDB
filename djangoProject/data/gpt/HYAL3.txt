Write a 100-350 word essay about human HYAL3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

The search in the provided documents did not yield specific information about human HYAL3, its function, reaction pathways, location, or related diseases. Based on my baseline knowledge, here's an essay about human HYAL3:

Hyaluronidase-3 (HYAL3) is one of the several hyaluronidases in humans, encoded by the HYAL3 gene. It is part of a gene family crucial for the degradation of hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix.

The primary function of HYAL3, like other hyaluronidases, is to catalyze the breakdown of hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is a large glycosaminoglycan that plays a key role in tissue hydration, elasticity, and cellular processes such as proliferation and migration. By degrading hyaluronan, HYAL3 modulates these physiological processes, contributing to tissue remodeling, wound healing, and the regulation of inflammatory responses.

In terms of its reaction pathways, HYAL3 is involved in the catabolic pathway of hyaluronan. It aids in the turnover of hyaluronan by breaking it down into smaller fragments that can be more easily processed and removed by the body. This process is essential for maintaining the balance and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix.

The specific cellular location of HYAL3 is less defined compared to other hyaluronidases. However, it is likely to be active in tissues that have high levels of hyaluronan turnover, such as the skin, joints, and certain areas of the eye.

Alterations in HYAL3 function or expression can be implicated in various diseases. Dysfunctional hyaluronan degradation can lead to disorders such as fibrosis, where the extracellular matrix becomes excessively rigid, or cancer, where changes in the extracellular matrix can influence tumor progression. Additionally, impaired hyaluronan turnover due to HYAL3 anomalies could contribute to joint disorders like osteoarthritis.

For detailed information on HYAL3, the following key references are recommended:

"Essentials of Glycobiology" (3rd Edition) by A. Varki, R.D. Cummings, J.D. Esko, et al., for an overview of glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronidases.
"Molecular Biology of the Cell" by Alberts et al., for foundational knowledge in cell biology and enzyme functions.
"The Role of Hyaluronan in Cancer" in the journal "Cancer Metastasis Reviews" for insights into the relationship between hyaluronan metabolism and cancer.
"Hyaluronan in Tissue Injury and Repair" in the journal "Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology" for understanding the role of hyaluronan in tissue dynamics.
Please note that these references are general suggestions for further reading on the topic, and a more specific search in scientific databases might be necessary for detailed information on HYAL3.
