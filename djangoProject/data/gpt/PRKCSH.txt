### Function
Human PRKCSH, or protein kinase C substrate 80K-H, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the proper folding and quality control of glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PRKCSH is better known as the beta-subunit of glucosidase II, an enzyme complex that removes glucose residues from glycoproteins during their maturation. This trimming process is essential for the correct folding of glycoproteins, allowing them to achieve their functional conformations.

### Reaction Pathways
PRKCSH functions within the glycoprotein processing pathway, where it assists glucosidase II in the removal of glucose residues from N-linked glycans on newly synthesized glycoproteins. After these glucose residues are added in the early stages of glycoprotein synthesis, they must be trimmed to enable proper folding and to prepare the glycoproteins for further processing and eventual export from the ER. PRKCSH, as part of the glucosidase II complex, ensures that this trimming process occurs efficiently, which is vital for maintaining cellular function and protein homeostasis.

### Location
PRKCSH is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in the quality control and processing of glycoproteins. The ER is the cellular organelle where proteins are synthesized, folded, and initially modified. The presence of PRKCSH in the ER allows it to participate in the early stages of protein maturation, ensuring that glycoproteins are properly processed before they are transported to the Golgi apparatus and beyond.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PRKCSH gene are associated with autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). This condition is characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the liver, which can lead to liver enlargement and complications such as pain, infections, and liver dysfunction. The mutations in PRKCSH result in a dysfunctional glucosidase II complex, leading to improper glycoprotein processing and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. This disruption in protein homeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of polycystic liver disease. Understanding PRKCSH's role in glycoprotein processing is essential for diagnosing and developing treatments for ADPLD.
