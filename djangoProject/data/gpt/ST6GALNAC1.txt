Human ST6GALNAC1 (ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates. Specifically, ST6GALNAC1 is involved in the transfer of sialic acid to the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process integral to the formation of complex carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces.

Located predominantly in the Golgi apparatus, ST6GALNAC1 catalyzes the addition of sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage to GalNAc. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing a range of biological activities such as cell-cell interaction, immune response, and signal transduction. The sialylation patterns mediated by ST6GALNAC1 affect the stability, half-life, and biological activity of the glycoconjugates.

The expression and activity of ST6GALNAC1 are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts. Aberrant expression or function of ST6GALNAC1 has been linked to cancer progression. In tumor cells, alterations in glycosylation, including sialylation, can affect cell adhesion, migration, and immune evasion capabilities. ST6GALNAC1-mediated sialylation is also implicated in other diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, where changes in glycan structures on the cell surface can impact immune cell recognition and function.

While direct links between specific diseases and mutations in the ST6GALNAC1 gene are not extensively documented, its role in critical glycosylation processes suggests potential involvement in various disorders, particularly those related to immune function and oncogenesis.

For more detailed information on ST6GALNAC1, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
