### Function
Human ALG10 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 10) is an essential glycosyltransferase involved in the final stages of the N-glycosylation pathway. This enzyme specifically adds the third glucose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, completing the formation of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure. This fully glucosylated oligosaccharide is necessary for proper protein folding and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

### Reaction Pathways
The reaction pathway catalyzed by ALG10 involves the transfer of glucose from dolichyl-phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The addition of the third glucose molecule is a critical step, as the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure serves as a signal for the binding of chaperone proteins such as calnexin and calreticulin. These chaperones ensure proper folding and prevent misfolded proteins from aggregating, facilitating their correct assembly and maturation before they are transported to the Golgi apparatus.

### Location
ALG10 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it integrates into the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the lumen. This location is strategic for its role in the glycosylation pathway, as the ER is the primary site for the initial stages of protein glycosylation. By being situated in the ER, ALG10 can efficiently interact with its substrates, dolichyl-phosphate glucose, and the growing oligosaccharide precursor to ensure proper glycan synthesis.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG10 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), particularly CDG type II (ALG10-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to the production of improperly folded glycoproteins. Symptoms of ALG10-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and various organ dysfunctions. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG10 is a vital enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating the final glucose addition necessary for proper protein folding and quality control. Its localization in the ER underscores its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG10 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in human health.
