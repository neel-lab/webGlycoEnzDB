Write a 100-350 word essay about human ALG10: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ALG10 (ALG10, Alpha-1,2-Glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme critical in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a central cellular process for protein folding and maturation. ALG10's function is essential for the stability and function of many proteins, affecting a broad range of biological processes.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG10 catalyzes the addition of glucose residues to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor during N-linked glycan synthesis. Specifically, ALG10 adds the final glucose residue to the growing oligosaccharide chain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This step is crucial for the complete assembly of the LLO, which is subsequently transferred to nascent proteins. The addition of glucose by ALG10 is critical for proper protein folding and quality control within the ER. This glucosylation process ensures that proteins attain the correct conformation before they are transported to their final destinations in the cell.

Location:
ALG10 is located in the ER, the site of N-linked glycosylation and initial protein folding. The ER’s role as the cellular hub for protein synthesis and maturation underscores the importance of ALG10’s enzymatic activity.

Diseases:
Dysfunction or mutations in ALG10 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the glycosylation process of proteins and lipids. Patients with ALG10-related CDG may present with symptoms like developmental delay, neurological issues, hypotonia, and other systemic manifestations. The severity of these symptoms reflects the essential role of glycosylation in numerous cellular functions and protein stability.
