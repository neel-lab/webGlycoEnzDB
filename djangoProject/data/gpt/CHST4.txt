### Function

Human CHST4 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 4), also known as N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (GlcNAc6ST-2), is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups from 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the 6-hydroxyl group of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues at the nonreducing end of glycans. This sulfation process is crucial for the formation of specific glycan structures, which play essential roles in cellular interactions, signaling, and adhesion.

### Reaction Pathways

CHST4 is involved in the biosynthesis of sulfated glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans. Within the Golgi apparatus, CHST4 transfers sulfate groups to GlcNAc residues on glycans. This sulfation step is a key modification that enhances the biological activity of these molecules, facilitating their interaction with selectins and other receptors. The enzyme is particularly important in the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands, which mediate lymphocyte homing to high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes.pdf】.

### Location

CHST4 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a type II transmembrane protein. Its active site faces the lumen of the Golgi, allowing it to access and modify its glycan substrates effectively. This localization is essential for its role in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, ensuring that these molecules are properly sulfated and functional before being transported to the cell surface or extracellular matrix.pdf】.

### Diseases

Mutations or dysregulation of CHST4 are associated with various pathological conditions. For instance, altered CHST4 expression has been detected in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a role in inflammatory processes. The enzyme's involvement in the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands also implicates it in disorders related to immune cell trafficking and inflammation. Additionally, aberrant sulfation patterns due to CHST4 dysregulation can impact cell adhesion and migration, contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and potentially affecting cancer progression.pdf】.

In summary, CHST4 is a critical enzyme in the sulfation of glycans, essential for proper cellular interactions and signaling. Its function and regulation are vital for maintaining normal physiological processes, and its dysregulation can lead to significant pathological conditions.
