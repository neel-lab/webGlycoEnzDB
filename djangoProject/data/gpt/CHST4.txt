Human CHST4, also known as N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (GlcNAc6ST-2), is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. It plays a significant role in modifying glycan structures by catalyzing the transfer of sulfate groups to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. This sulfation process is essential for various biological functions, including cell signaling, cell adhesion, and the formation of the extracellular matrix.

The enzyme CHST4 belongs to a subfamily of carbohydrate sulfotransferases that modify the 6-hydroxyl group of galactose (Gal), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), or GlcNAc. The addition of sulfate groups by CHST4 to these sugar residues enhances the biological activity of the glycans in which they are found. This sulfation is critical for interactions with proteins such as cytokines and growth factors, influencing various physiological processes.

Structurally, CHST4 is a type II transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a luminal C-terminal catalytic domain, typical of Golgi sulfotransferases. This structure is essential for its function in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins.

In terms of disease associations, abnormalities in CHST4 function or expression can lead to various pathological conditions. For instance, altered glycan sulfation due to dysfunction of CHST4 could affect cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, potentially contributing to disorders in tissues where these modified glycans are critical components. Additionally, the role of CHST4 in cell signaling suggests its potential involvement in cancer development and progression.

For more detailed information on human CHST4, the following key references are recommended:

Fukuda et al. (2001), Hemmerich et al. (1991): These studies provide insights into the enzymatic function and substrate specificity of CHST4.
Kim et al. (2003), Kakuta et al. (1998, 1997): Explore the structure and evolutionary relationship of CHST4 within the family of Golgi sulfotransferases.
Understanding the role of CHST4 in glycan biosynthesis is crucial for advancing knowledge in cellular communication, tissue integrity, and the potential implications of its dysfunction in various health conditions​​​​.
