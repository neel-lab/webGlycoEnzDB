Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGX: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGX (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class X) is an enzyme crucial in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are complex molecules that attach a variety of proteins to the cell surface, playing essential roles in numerous cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune responses.

PIGX specifically participates in the early stages of GPI anchor synthesis. It is involved in the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI), a fundamental step in the initial formation of the GPI anchor. This step is crucial for the successful biosynthesis of GPI anchors and subsequent attachment of proteins to the cell membrane.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGX operates within a complex enzymatic pathway that constructs GPI anchors. The proper assembly of GPI anchors is vital for the correct localization and function of various cell surface proteins, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules.

Dysfunctions or mutations in PIGX can potentially lead to GPI anchor deficiencies, impacting the proper expression and function of GPI-anchored proteins. While specific diseases directly linked to PIGX mutations are not widely documented, impairments in GPI anchor biosynthesis can cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). Patients with GPIBDs may exhibit symptoms such as developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizures, highlighting the importance of GPI anchors in neural development and physiological processes.

For more information on PIGX and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
