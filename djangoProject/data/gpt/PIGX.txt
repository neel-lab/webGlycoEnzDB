### Function
Human PIGX, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class X, is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the initial steps of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, where they participate in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGX is a key component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which is responsible for the first step in GPI anchor formation—the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGX functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, specifically at the beginning of this process. As part of the GPI-GnT complex, PIGX assists in the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol, forming GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol. This reaction is the first committed step in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, setting the stage for subsequent modifications that produce a mature GPI anchor capable of anchoring proteins to the cell membrane.

### Location
PIGX is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it contributes to the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. The ER is the site of protein synthesis and early post-translational modifications, making it the ideal environment for PIGX to function within the GPI-GnT complex. PIGX’s presence in the ER ensures that GPI anchor biosynthesis begins efficiently, allowing for the proper attachment of proteins to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGX gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by a range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays. These conditions arise from defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to the improper function or absence of GPI-anchored proteins. As these proteins are critical for many cellular processes, their dysfunction can result in significant clinical challenges. Understanding PIGX’s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for diagnosing and developing potential treatments for these disorders.
