Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST3GAL3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST3GAL3 (ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3) is an enzyme integral to the process of sialylation, a form of glycosylation that involves the addition of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzymatic action is crucial for the biological function and structural integrity of various cellular components.

Located primarily in the Golgi apparatus, ST3GAL3 facilitates the transfer of sialic acid to the terminal galactose residues in oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. The specific action of ST3GAL3 leads to the formation of alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid structures, which are critical for a range of cellular processes including cell signaling, immune responses, and cell-cell recognition. 

The role of ST3GAL3 is significant in the brain, where it contributes to neural development and cognitive function. Sialylated glycoconjugates, produced with the participation of ST3GAL3, are involved in modulating cell interactions, signal transduction, and synaptic plasticity. 

Dysfunction or mutations in the ST3GAL3 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. Notably, mutations in ST3GAL3 are associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, learning difficulties, and behavioral challenges, which may be partly attributed to altered sialylation affecting neural function and connectivity.

For more detailed information on ST3GAL3, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
