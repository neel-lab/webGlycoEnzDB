### Function
Human ST3GAL3, or ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3, is an enzyme responsible for the transfer of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Specifically, ST3GAL3 catalyzes the addition of sialic acid in an alpha-2,3 linkage to galactose residues on N-linked and O-linked glycans. This sialylation is essential for modifying the structure and function of glycoproteins and glycolipids, affecting processes such as cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein stability.

### Reaction Pathways
ST3GAL3 operates within the sialylation pathway, where it transfers sialic acid from the donor molecule CMP-sialic acid to the terminal galactose residues of glycan chains. This process is vital for creating sialylated glycans, which play critical roles in cell signaling, receptor activity, and the prevention of protein degradation. The enzyme's activity is essential for the formation of functional glycoproteins and glycolipids that are involved in various cellular processes.

### Location
ST3GAL3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the central organelle for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, ST3GAL3 ensures that glycoproteins and glycolipids are properly sialylated before they are transported to their final cellular destinations. This localization is crucial for the enzyme to participate effectively in the post-translational modification of proteins, ensuring that they achieve their full functional potential.

### Diseases
Mutations or dysregulation of ST3GAL3 have been linked to several developmental and neurological disorders. For example, mutations in the ST3GAL3 gene have been associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability, a condition characterized by cognitive impairment and developmental delays. Additionally, altered sialylation patterns influenced by ST3GAL3 activity can contribute to cancer progression, as these modifications can affect cell adhesion, migration, and immune evasion. Understanding the role of ST3GAL3 is critical for developing therapeutic strategies for conditions related to abnormal sialylation and glycosylation processes.
