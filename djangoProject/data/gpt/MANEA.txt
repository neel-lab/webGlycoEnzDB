Write a 100-350 word essay about human MANEA: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

Human MANEA, also known as Golgi endo-α-mannosidase, plays a crucial role in the processing of N-glycans within the Golgi apparatus. Its primary function involves the cleavage of specific mannose residues in N-glycan structures. Specifically, MANEA acts on N-glycans in the cis-Golgi that retain a glucose (Glc) residue due to incomplete processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this context, MANEA cleaves internally between two mannose (Man) residues in the Glcα1-3Manα1-2Manα1-2 moiety. This action results in the generation of a Man8 GlcNAc2 isomer, which is distinct from the one produced by ER α-mannosidase I (MAN1B1). Following this, the trimming of α1-2Man residues continues with the action of α1-2 mannosidases IA.

MANEA is localized in the cis-Golgi compartment of cells, where it contributes to the complex and critical process of protein glycosylation. The proper functioning of MANEA is essential for the correct processing and maturation of glycoproteins, which have numerous roles in cellular function and communication.

Dysfunction or anomalies in MANEA, like other enzymes involved in glycosylation, can lead to various diseases, particularly those related to improper glycoprotein formation and function. While specific diseases directly linked to MANEA anomalies are not extensively documented in the provided materials, it is known that disorders in glycosylation processes can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), which encompass a range of genetic disorders affecting glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis.

For further detailed information and research on human MANEA, its function, reaction pathways, and related diseases, the following key scientific references are recommended:
