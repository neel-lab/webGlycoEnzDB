Write a 100-350 word essay about human CHST10: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human CHST10 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 10), also known as HNK-1ST, is a unique enzyme involved in the modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Its role is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope, a sulfated glycan structure.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CHST10 is responsible for the sulfation of specific carbohydrate moieties, particularly glucuronic acid in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This sulfation leads to the formation of the HNK-1 epitope (3'-sulfated glucuronic acid), which is present on a variety of neural cell adhesion molecules, such as NCAM (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule). The HNK-1 epitope plays a crucial role in cell-cell interactions, neural development, and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in processes like neuron migration, axon guidance, and synaptic stabilization, essential for proper nervous system development and function.

Location:
CHST10 is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This localization is essential for its function in adding sulfate groups to specific substrates, thereby contributing to the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope.

Diseases:
Disruption or alteration in CHST10 function can have implications in neurological development and function. Given its role in neural cell adhesion and signaling, abnormal CHST10 activity may contribute to developmental neurological disorders and potentially influence the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have suggested potential links between altered CHST10 activity or expression and conditions such as schizophrenia, although these connections require further investigation.

Key References:
For more detailed information on CHST10, consider the following key references:
