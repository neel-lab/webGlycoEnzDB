Write a 100-350 word essay about human CANX: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human CANX, or Calnexin, is an integral membrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It plays a crucial role in the quality control of protein folding, particularly for glycoproteins. CANX's function is vital for cellular homeostasis and has implications in various diseases.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CANX functions as a chaperone in the ER, where it binds to newly synthesized glycoproteins. It recognizes and binds to a specific glycan structure on these proteins, consisting of a single glucose residue attached to an oligosaccharide chain. This binding is crucial for the proper folding of glycoproteins, as it retains them within the ER until they achieve their correct conformation. Once the glycoproteins are properly folded, they are transported to their destination outside the ER. This selective binding and release mechanism ensures that only correctly folded proteins proceed through the secretory pathway, preventing misfolded proteins from accumulating, which could be detrimental to the cell.

Location:
CANX is located in the ER, where its chaperone activity is essential for maintaining the quality control of proteins that pass through the secretory pathway. Its location in the ER is strategic for its role in monitoring and assisting in the folding process of nascent glycoproteins.

Diseases:
Mutations or malfunctions in the protein folding process, in which CANX is involved, can lead to various diseases. For instance, improper folding and accumulation of misfolded proteins are a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the dysregulation of CANX function can contribute to cystic fibrosis and some forms of diabetes, where the misfolding of crucial proteins plays a pathogenic role.

Key References:
For more detailed information on CANX, the following references are recommended:
