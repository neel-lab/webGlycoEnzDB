Write a 100-350 word essay about human POGLUT3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human POGLUT3 (Protein O-Glucosyltransferase 3) is a relatively newly characterized enzyme in the family of O-glucosyltransferases. Similar to POGLUT1 and POGLUT2, POGLUT3 plays a role in the post-translational modification of proteins, particularly in the O-glucosylation of serine or threonine residues within epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) repeats. This enzymatic process is crucial for the proper folding, stability, and function of EGF-like repeat-containing proteins.

The exact physiological functions of POGLUT3 are still being elucidated, but it is believed to contribute to the O-glucosylation of a subset of proteins distinct from those modified by POGLUT1 and POGLUT2. The substrates and specific roles of POGLUT3 in cellular processes are areas of ongoing research.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), POGLUT3 is strategically positioned to modify newly synthesized proteins. The O-glucosylation carried out by POGLUT3 is likely to influence protein-protein interactions, cellular signaling pathways, and various biological processes, potentially including cell communication and development.

As of now, direct links between POGLUT3 dysfunction and specific human diseases are not well established, but given the importance of protein O-glucosylation in cell regulation, it's plausible that anomalies in POGLUT3 could contribute to developmental or cellular dysfunctions. Further research is required to understand the full scope of POGLUT3's roles in human physiology and pathology.
