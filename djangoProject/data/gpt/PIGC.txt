Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGC: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGC (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class C) is a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are glycolipids that attach various proteins to the cell membrane, playing vital roles in cell signaling, adhesion, and recognition.

PIGC is responsible for the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI), a key initial step in the complex process of GPI anchor synthesis. This step is essential for the formation of GPI anchors, which are subsequently modified and attached to proteins. GPI-anchored proteins have diverse functions, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules, and are involved in a range of biological processes.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGC's activity is critical for the proper assembly and function of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface. Dysfunctions in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, including deficiencies in PIGC, can lead to GPI anchor deficiencies, impacting a multitude of cellular processes.

Defects in GPI anchor synthesis are linked to several genetic disorders collectively known as GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). These conditions can manifest with a wide array of symptoms, such as intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delays, highlighting the importance of GPI anchors in neuronal development and function.

For more detailed information on PIGC and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
