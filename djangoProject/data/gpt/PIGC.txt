### Function
Human PIGC, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C, is an enzyme involved in the early stages of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are glycolipid structures that tether certain proteins to the cell membrane, playing vital roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGC is part of a multi-subunit enzyme complex responsible for transferring N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol, the first committed step in GPI anchor assembly.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGC functions within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, specifically in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is part of the enzyme complex that catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol, forming GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol. This reaction is the initial and crucial step in the assembly of GPI anchors, which undergo further modifications and elongation before being attached to proteins. The proper function of PIGC is essential for the correct synthesis and functionality of GPI-anchored proteins.

### Location
PIGC is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where GPI anchor biosynthesis begins. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGC to interact with other components of the GPI biosynthesis machinery, ensuring that the early steps of anchor formation occur efficiently. This localization is critical for the enzyme's role in initiating GPI anchor synthesis, which is essential for the eventual attachment of GPI-anchored proteins to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGC gene can lead to defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, contributing to a group of disorders known as inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs). These disorders are characterized by a range of symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological impairments. The improper formation of GPI anchors due to dysfunctional PIGC results in the mislocalization and loss of function of GPI-anchored proteins, which are critical for normal cellular function. Understanding PIGC's role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is vital for diagnosing and developing therapeutic approaches for these conditions.
