Human CHST12 (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 12) is a vital enzyme involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans, particularly chondroitin sulfate. Its role is crucial in various physiological processes, particularly in the development and maintenance of connective tissues.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CHST12 specifically catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the chondroitin sulfate, a key component of the extracellular matrix found in connective tissues like cartilage, skin, and blood vessels. This sulfation process is vital as it confers specific biological properties to chondroitin sulfate, including its interaction with various proteins like growth factors, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules. These interactions are essential for cell signaling, structural integrity, and tissue hydration. CHST12's activity is crucial in determining the degree of sulfation of chondroitin sulfate, thereby influencing its function in connective tissues.

Location:
CHST12 is predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of proteoglycans. The enzyme's presence in the Golgi apparatus ensures that chondroitin sulfate is properly sulfated as part of its biosynthesis process before being transported to its functional destinations in the cell or extracellular matrix.

Diseases:
Dysfunction or mutations in CHST12 can potentially lead to abnormalities in the structure and function of connective tissues. Given its role in modifying chondroitin sulfate, aberrations in CHST12 activity could contribute to disorders related to abnormal cartilage development, joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, and impaired wound healing. Additionally, altered chondroitin sulfate sulfation patterns may impact tissue development and regeneration, as well as pathological conditions like cancer and inflammation.

Key References:
For more detailed information on CHST12, consider the following key references:
