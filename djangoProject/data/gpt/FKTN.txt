Human FKTN (Fukutin) is an essential gene involved in the glycosylation of dystroglycan, a key protein required for maintaining muscle integrity and function. The FKTN gene encodes for the fukutin protein, which plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of dystroglycan, particularly in muscular and neurological development.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
Fukutin is involved in the addition of ribitol-phosphate to O-mannosylated glycan chains on dystroglycan, a part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. This glycosylation is crucial for dystroglycanâ€™s ability to bind to extracellular matrix components like laminin, which is essential for the stability and structural integrity of muscle cells. Proper glycosylation by fukutin ensures effective communication between the muscle cell cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, playing a critical role in muscle strength and resilience.

Location:
Fukutin is localized predominantly in the Golgi apparatus of cells, where it performs its glycosylation function. This localization is strategic for its role in the processing and modification of dystroglycan as it passes through the secretory pathway of muscle cells.

Diseases:
Mutations in the FKTN gene are linked to several types of muscular dystrophies, including Fukuyama Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (FCMD), a severe form of dystrophy characterized by brain malformations and muscular weakness, and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. These conditions result from impaired glycosylation of dystroglycan, leading to weakened muscle integrity and function. The severity of the disease can vary depending on the nature of the mutation in the FKTN gene.

Key References:
For more detailed information on FKTN and its role in muscular dystrophies, consider the following key references:
