### Function

Human EOGT (EGF domain-specific O-GlcNAc transferase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues to serine or threonine residues within epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of proteins. This post-translational modification, known as O-GlcNAcylation, is crucial for the proper functioning of several proteins, including those involved in signaling pathways. EOGT specifically modifies proteins such as Notch and its ligands, thereby playing a significant role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes .

### Reaction Pathways

EOGT functions by transferring GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues in the EGF-like repeats of target proteins. This glycosylation occurs within the secretory pathway and is necessary for the proper folding, stability, and function of these glycoproteins. The addition of O-GlcNAc by EOGT can influence protein-protein interactions and modulate signaling pathways, particularly the Notch signaling pathway. Notch receptors, when glycosylated by EOGT, have altered interactions with their ligands, impacting cell fate decisions during development.

### Location

EOGT is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it encounters nascent glycoproteins undergoing modification. The enzyme’s localization within these organelles allows it to efficiently modify EGF-like repeats in proteins that are part of the secretory pathway. This subcellular distribution is essential for the enzyme's role in modifying proteins that are either secreted or displayed on the cell surface, facilitating their proper function and signaling capabilities.

### Diseases

Mutations in the EOGT gene are linked to Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), a rare congenital disorder characterized by defects in the development of the skin, limbs, and vasculature. AOS type 4, specifically associated with EOGT mutations, manifests as aplasia cutis congenita (absence of skin) and limb anomalies, reflecting the enzyme’s critical role in developmental processes mediated by Notch signaling. Additionally, dysfunction in O-GlcNAcylation due to EOGT mutations can disrupt vascular development and integrity, further emphasizing its importance in developmental and physiological processes.

In summary, human EOGT is a vital enzyme responsible for the O-GlcNAcylation of EGF-like repeats in glycoproteins, significantly impacting Notch signaling and development. Its localization in the ER and Golgi apparatus facilitates its role in protein modification, and mutations in EOGT can lead to severe developmental disorders such as Adams-Oliver syndrome.
