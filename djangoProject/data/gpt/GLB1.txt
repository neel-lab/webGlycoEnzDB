Write a 100-350 word essay about human GLB1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human GLB1, or Beta-galactosidase, is a lysosomal enzyme playing a key role in the degradation of glycolipids and glycoproteins.

Function
GLB1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal beta-galactose residues from various glycoconjugates, including gangliosides, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans. This enzymatic action is essential for the degradation and recycling of glycolipids and glycoproteins in lysosomes. The proper functioning of GLB1 prevents the accumulation of glycoconjugates in cells, crucial for maintaining cellular health.

Reaction Pathways
GLB1 is involved in the lysosomal catabolic pathway for glycoconjugates. It breaks down complex molecules containing beta-galactose residues, which are common in various cellular structures. The degradation process mediated by GLB1 ensures the proper turnover of glycoconjugates and prevents their buildup within the lysosomes.

Location
GLB1 is located in the lysosomes, which are organelles responsible for the degradation and recycling of macromolecules in cells. Lysosomes contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, including GLB1, which degrade various substrates delivered to them.

Related Diseases
Deficiencies or mutations in the GLB1 gene can lead to two main disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B syndrome. GM1 gangliosidosis is characterized by the accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in the brain and other organs, leading to severe neurological symptoms. Morquio B syndrome, a form of mucopolysaccharidosis, results from the accumulation of keratan sulfate and is associated with skeletal abnormalities and other systemic symptoms.
