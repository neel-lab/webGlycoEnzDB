Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human EXTL3. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function

Human EXTL3 (exostosin-like 3) is a glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin. EXTL3 has dual enzymatic activities: it acts as both an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) and a GlcNAcT-II, responsible for initiating and elongating the HS chains. This enzyme is crucial for adding GlcNAc residues to the growing HS chains, a process essential for the structural integrity and function of HS .

### Reaction Pathways

EXTL3 functions within the heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway. It initiates HS chain formation by transferring a GlcNAc residue to the tetrasaccharide linker region on a proteoglycan core protein. Following this initiation, EXTL3 also participates in the elongation of the HS chains by adding additional GlcNAc residues. The enzymeâ€™s activity ensures that HS chains are properly assembled, which is crucial for their subsequent sulfation and biological functions, including cell signaling and interaction with various growth factors.

### Location

EXTL3 is localized primarily in the Golgi apparatus, where it performs its glycosyltransferase functions. The Golgi is the central site for protein modification and trafficking within the cell, making it an ideal location for EXTL3 to interact with other enzymes and substrates involved in HS biosynthesis. This localization allows for the efficient processing of glycoproteins and the correct assembly of HS chains before they are transported to the cell surface .

### Diseases

Mutations in the EXTL3 gene are associated with various pathological conditions, including hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) and certain cancers. HME is characterized by the formation of multiple benign bone tumors, known as osteochondromas. These tumors can lead to skeletal deformities and, in some cases, may undergo malignant transformation into chondrosarcoma. Additionally, alterations in EXTL3 expression have been linked to developmental disorders and abnormalities in brain development, underscoring the enzyme's critical role in both skeletal and neural development .

In summary, human EXTL3 is a key enzyme in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, playing essential roles in both the initiation and elongation of HS chains. Its localization in the Golgi apparatus ensures proper assembly of these glycan structures, while mutations in EXTL3 are implicated in significant diseases, including hereditary multiple exostoses and certain cancers.
