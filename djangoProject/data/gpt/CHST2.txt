Human CHST2 (Carbohydrate (N-acetylglucosamine-6-O) Sulfotransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays an important role in the post-translational modification of glycosaminoglycans, particularly in the sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. This sulfation is vital for the biological function of various glycosaminoglycans, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix and play key roles in numerous physiological processes.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CHST2 catalyzes the addition of sulfate groups to the 6-position of GlcNAc residues within keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. This sulfation process is crucial as it confers negative charges to these glycosaminoglycans, significantly affecting their ability to bind to various proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components. These interactions are essential for processes such as cell signaling, development, and wound healing. The sulfation pattern introduced by CHST2 is crucial for the function of these glycosaminoglycans in biological activities ranging from cell adhesion and migration to blood coagulation and inflammation.

Location:
CHST2 is located in the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in the biosynthesis and modification of glycosaminoglycans. Its activity in the Golgi is crucial for ensuring that these biomolecules are properly sulfated before they are transported to their functional destinations in the cell or extracellular matrix.

Diseases:
Alterations in CHST2 function can have implications in various diseases. Given its role in the modification of heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate, dysfunction in CHST2 could potentially contribute to disorders related to abnormal cell signaling, impaired blood coagulation, or defects in cartilage and bone development. For example, improper sulfation patterns can lead to altered interactions with growth factors, impacting tissue regeneration and repair processes.

Key References:
