Human GFPT2 (Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase 2), also known as glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 2, plays a key role in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which is crucial for several cellular functions. GFPT2 is one of the two isoenzymes (GFPT1 and GFPT2) that regulate the entry of glucose into the HBP.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
GFPT2 catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine to glucosamine-6-phosphate and glutamate, the rate-limiting step in the HBP. This pathway is responsible for producing uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a vital substrate for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Glycosylation is essential for protein folding, stability, and signaling, impacting numerous cellular processes.

Location:
GFPT2 is expressed in various tissues, including muscle and adipose tissue. Its expression and activity can be influenced by metabolic states, like hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, highlighting its involvement in metabolic regulation.

Diseases:
Alterations in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, potentially due to dysregulation of GFPT2, have been implicated in several metabolic disorders. The most notable is type 2 diabetes, where increased flux through the HBP can lead to insulin resistance. The pathway's role in protein glycosylation also links it to various other cellular dysfunctions, potentially contributing to the development of complications associated with diabetes and other metabolic syndromes.
