### Function
Human SLC2A4, commonly known as GLUT4, is a glucose transporter that plays a vital role in glucose uptake in insulin-responsive tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. GLUT4 is unique among glucose transporters because it is regulated by insulin, which triggers its translocation from intracellular storage vesicles to the cell membrane, thereby increasing glucose uptake into the cell. This process is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels, especially after meals.

### Reaction Pathways
GLUT4 operates within the insulin-mediated glucose uptake pathway. Upon insulin binding to its receptor on the cell surface, a signaling cascade is activated that results in the translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. Once at the membrane, GLUT4 facilitates the passive transport of glucose into the cell, where it can be used for energy production via glycolysis or stored as glycogen in muscle and fat cells. This process is essential for reducing blood glucose levels and storing energy for later use.

### Location
SLC2A4 is primarily found in insulin-sensitive tissues, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and to a lesser extent, the heart. Under basal conditions, GLUT4 is stored in intracellular vesicles within these cells. In response to insulin, GLUT4 translocates to the plasma membrane, increasing the cell's capacity to take up glucose from the bloodstream. This localization and regulation are key to GLUT4â€™s role in managing glucose homeostasis.

### Diseases
Impaired GLUT4 function or expression is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In these conditions, the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane in response to insulin is diminished, leading to decreased glucose uptake, elevated blood glucose levels, and the development of hyperglycemia. Understanding GLUT4's role in glucose metabolism is critical for developing treatments aimed at improving insulin sensitivity and managing type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, mutations in the SLC2A4 gene could potentially contribute to metabolic syndromes, although such cases are rare.
