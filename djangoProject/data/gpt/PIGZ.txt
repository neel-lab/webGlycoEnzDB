Write a 100-350 word essay about human PIGZ: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human PIGZ (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class Z) is an enzyme that plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are critical glycolipids that attach a variety of proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating key cellular functions such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune regulation.

PIGZ is involved in one of the later steps of GPI anchor synthesis, where it participates in the transfer of a side-chain ethanolamine phosphate to the third mannose of the GPI precursor. This step is crucial for the proper structure and functionality of GPI anchors, enabling them to effectively anchor proteins to the cell surface.

Located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PIGZ functions within the complex enzymatic pathway that constructs GPI anchors. Proper GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for the correct localization, stability, and functioning of various cell surface proteins, including enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules.

While specific diseases directly linked to PIGZ dysfunction are not extensively documented, impairments in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway can lead to GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). These rare genetic disorders may present with a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. These symptoms reflect the critical role of GPI-anchored proteins in developmental and neurological processes.

For more detailed information on PIGZ and its role in GPI anchor biosynthesis, the following key references are recommended:
