### Function
Human PIGZ, or phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class Z, is an enzyme involved in the final steps of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors are critical glycolipid structures that attach specific proteins to the cell membrane, allowing them to participate in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and cell adhesion. PIGZ is responsible for adding the fourth mannose residue to the GPI precursor, a crucial step in the assembly and maturation of the GPI anchor.

### Reaction Pathways
PIGZ operates within the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, specifically during the later stages of this process. After the initial mannose residues have been added to the GPI precursor by other enzymes, PIGZ catalyzes the transfer of the fourth mannose from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) to the growing GPI structure. This mannose addition is essential for the proper formation of a functional GPI anchor, which will undergo further modifications before being attached to proteins destined for the cell membrane.

### Location
PIGZ is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular organelle where the early steps of protein synthesis and post-translational modifications take place. The ER provides the necessary environment for PIGZ to perform its role in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway, ensuring that the GPI anchors are correctly assembled. This ER localization is crucial for the proper processing and function of GPI-anchored proteins, which are then transported to the cell membrane.

### Diseases
Mutations in the PIGZ gene are associated with inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological impairments. These conditions arise due to defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, leading to the improper function or mislocalization of GPI-anchored proteins. The dysfunction of these proteins can disrupt critical cellular processes, contributing to the clinical manifestations of IGDs. Understanding PIGZâ€™s role in GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential for diagnosing and developing treatments for these disorders.
