Write a 100-350 word essay about human ALG1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ALG1 (Asparagine-Linked Glycosylation 1, also known as Mannosyltransferase 1) is a crucial enzyme in the process of N-linked glycosylation, a fundamental biochemical pathway for protein folding and maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ALG1's role is integral in the early stages of N-glycan synthesis, which is essential for the stability and function of many proteins.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG1 catalyzes the addition of the first mannose to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor, Dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2, in the ER. This step is part of the assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor that is eventually transferred to nascent proteins, a process critical for proper protein folding and quality control within the ER. The addition of mannose by ALG1 is a key step in building the complex branched structure of N-linked glycans.

Location:
ALG1 is located in the ER, where N-linked glycosylation occurs. This subcellular localization aligns with its role in synthesizing and modifying glycan precursors attached to the lipid carrier dolichol.

Diseases:
Mutations in the ALG1 gene can lead to ALG1-CDG (Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation), a rare genetic disorder. This condition is part of a group of metabolic disorders that affect the synthesis and attachment of glycans to proteins and lipids. Patients with ALG1-CDG typically present with severe developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and various other symptoms. The severity of the disorder reflects the fundamental nature of N-linked glycosylation in a multitude of cellular processes and protein functions.
