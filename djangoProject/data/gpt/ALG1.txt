### Function
Human ALG1 (asparagine-linked glycosylation protein 1 homolog) is an essential glycosyltransferase involved in the early stages of N-linked glycosylation. ALG1 specifically functions as a beta-1,4-mannosyltransferase, catalyzing the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues on the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. This process is crucial for forming the core glycan structure that will eventually be attached to proteins.

### Reaction Pathways
The reaction pathway of ALG1 involves the addition of the first mannose residue to the GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol complex, a key step in the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor necessary for N-glycosylation. The enzyme transfers a mannose molecule from GDP-mannose to the GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This reaction is the initial mannosylation step, followed by subsequent mannosylation and glucosylation steps to build the mature glycan structure.

### Location
ALG1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it integrates into the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. This strategic location allows ALG1 to access its substrates, GDP-mannose and GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, which are also synthesized and modified within the ER. The ER is the central site for the initial steps of N-glycosylation, where core glycan structures are assembled before being transferred to nascent polypeptides.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG1 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ik (ALG1-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG1-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, coagulation abnormalities, and liver dysfunction. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG1 is a vital enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating the initial mannosylation step necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its location in the ER and involvement in core glycan synthesis highlight its importance in cellular function and its association with serious congenital disorders when mutated.
