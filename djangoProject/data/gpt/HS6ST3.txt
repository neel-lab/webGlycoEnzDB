Write a 100-350 word essay about human HS6ST3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 3 (HS6ST3) is a critical enzyme in the modification of heparan sulfate, a vital glycosaminoglycan involved in a range of biological processes. This enzyme plays a significant role in the biosynthesis and functional specification of heparan sulfate.

The primary function of HS6ST3 is to transfer sulfate groups to the 6-O position of glucosamine residues within heparan sulfate chains. This sulfation process is crucial for the biological activity of heparan sulfate, influencing its interaction with various proteins, including growth factors, chemokines, and structural components of the extracellular matrix. These interactions are essential in numerous physiological processes such as cell signaling, development, and homeostasis.

HS6ST3 participates in the heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway, specifically in the sulfation of heparan sulfate within the Golgi apparatus. This step is vital for the final maturation of heparan sulfate, affecting its structure and function.

In terms of expression patterns, HS6ST3 is slightly expressed in the human brain, connective tissue, and kidney. This expression pattern suggests its potential role in neurological, connective tissue, and renal functions​​.

Alterations in the function or expression of HS6ST3 may lead to various diseases, particularly those related to impaired cell signaling and extracellular matrix interactions. Due to its involvement in neural and connective tissue, abnormalities in HS6ST3 could potentially contribute to neurological disorders and connective tissue diseases.

For more in-depth information on HS6ST3, the following references are suggested:
