### Function
Human HS6ST3, or heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 3, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the modification of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan involved in various cellular processes. HS6ST3 catalyzes the addition of a sulfate group to the 6-O position of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate chains. This sulfation is essential for enabling heparan sulfate to interact with various proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, and enzymes, which regulate processes such as cell signaling, tissue development, and angiogenesis.

### Reaction Pathways
HS6ST3 functions within the heparan sulfate biosynthesis pathway. After the heparan sulfate chains are polymerized and undergo initial modifications, HS6ST3 adds sulfate groups to the 6-O position of specific glucosamine residues. This specific modification is critical for the functional diversity of heparan sulfate, allowing it to engage in specific interactions with proteins that control cell communication, morphogenesis, and cellular responses to external signals. The sulfation by HS6ST3 enhances the ability of heparan sulfate to mediate essential biological processes.

### Location
HS6ST3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the organelle responsible for processing and modifying proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, HS6ST3 modifies heparan sulfate proteoglycans, ensuring they receive the necessary sulfation before being transported to the cell surface or the extracellular matrix. This Golgi localization is vital for the enzymeâ€™s role in the final stages of heparan sulfate biosynthesis, preparing it for its diverse functions in cellular processes.

### Diseases
Alterations in HS6ST3 activity have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Dysregulation of HS6ST3 can lead to abnormal sulfation patterns in heparan sulfate, which may contribute to tumor growth, metastasis, and altered angiogenesis by disrupting key signaling pathways. Additionally, given its role in development, mutations in HS6ST3 could result in congenital abnormalities or other developmental issues. Understanding the function of HS6ST3 is essential for developing therapeutic strategies that target aberrant heparan sulfate sulfation in disease contexts.
