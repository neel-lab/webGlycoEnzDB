### Function
Human SLC2A2, also known as GLUT2, is a glucose transporter that plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body. GLUT2 facilitates the bidirectional transport of glucose across cell membranes, allowing cells to take in glucose or release it into the bloodstream as needed. This transporter is vital for sensing glucose levels and regulating insulin secretion, particularly in the liver, pancreas, intestines, and kidneys.

### Reaction Pathways
GLUT2 functions primarily in the glucose transport pathway. Unlike other glucose transporters, GLUT2 has a low affinity but high capacity for glucose, meaning it transports glucose efficiently when glucose concentrations are high. This makes it well-suited for organs like the liver and pancreas, where it plays a role in glucose sensing and the regulation of insulin release. In the liver, GLUT2 enables the uptake of excess glucose for storage as glycogen after meals and facilitates glucose release during fasting. In the pancreas, it helps beta cells sense blood glucose levels, triggering insulin secretion.

### Location
SLC2A2 is primarily expressed in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and intestines. In the liver, GLUT2 enables glucose uptake and release, depending on the body's metabolic state. In pancreatic beta cells, it allows glucose entry, which is crucial for glucose sensing and insulin secretion. In the intestines, GLUT2 is involved in the absorption of dietary sugars, while in the kidneys, it plays a role in glucose reabsorption.

### Diseases
Mutations in the SLC2A2 gene are associated with Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by impaired glucose and galactose transport, leading to symptoms such as hepatomegaly, kidney dysfunction, growth retardation, and glucose intolerance. Additionally, dysfunction of GLUT2 can contribute to the development of metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, where impaired glucose sensing and insulin secretion play a central role. Understanding GLUT2's function is critical for diagnosing and treating these metabolic disorders.
