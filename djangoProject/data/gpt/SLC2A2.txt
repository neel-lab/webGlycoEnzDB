Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC2A2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC2A2, commonly known as GLUT2, is a facilitative glucose transporter with a unique role in glucose metabolism due to its low affinity but high capacity for glucose. It is distinctively involved in glucose sensing and homeostasis, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of blood sugar levels.

Located primarily in the liver, pancreas, intestine, and kidney, GLUT2 enables the bidirectional transport of glucose across cell membranes. In the liver, it facilitates glucose uptake for glycogen synthesis during the postprandial state and glucose release during fasting. In pancreatic beta cells, GLUT2 contributes to glucose sensing, which is critical for the regulation of insulin secretion. In the intestines and kidneys, GLUT2 is involved in glucose absorption from the diet and reabsorption from the filtrate, respectively.

Due to its key role in glucose homeostasis, dysfunction in GLUT2 can lead to significant metabolic disturbances. One notable disease associated with GLUT2 mutations is Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS), a rare genetic disorder. FBS is characterized by glycogen accumulation in the liver and kidneys, impaired glucose and galactose utilization, and renal tubular dysfunction leading to aminoaciduria and phosphaturia. Patients typically present with growth retardation, rickets, and hepatomegaly.
