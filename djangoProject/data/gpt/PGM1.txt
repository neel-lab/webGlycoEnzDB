Write a 100-350 word essay about human PGM1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human PGM1 (Phosphoglucomutase 1) is a vital enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, playing a central role in both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and glycolysis (the breakdown of glucose). PGM1 catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), a critical step that links these two major metabolic pathways.

Located predominantly in the cytoplasm, PGM1 is essential for efficient energy production and storage in cells. In glycogenolysis, it facilitates the conversion of G1P, derived from glycogen, into G6P, which can enter glycolysis for energy production. In glycolysis, PGM1 is involved in the reverse conversion, allowing for the synthesis and storage of glycogen from glucose.

Dysfunction in PGM1 can lead to a rare genetic disorder known as Phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency or PGM1-CDG (Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation). This condition is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including growth retardation, muscle weakness, liver dysfunction, and issues with blood coagulation. The multisystemic nature of this disorder reflects the widespread importance of PGM1 in various metabolic processes.

For more detailed information on PGM1 and its associated disorder, the following key references are recommended:
