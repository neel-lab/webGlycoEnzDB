### Function
Human GNPTAB, or N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunits alpha/beta, is an enzyme complex essential for the proper targeting of lysosomal enzymes. GNPTAB catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tags, which are crucial for directing enzymes to the lysosomes. This tagging process ensures that enzymes required for breaking down various biomolecules are correctly delivered to lysosomes, where they carry out their degradative functions.

### Reaction Pathways
GNPTAB functions within the pathway responsible for lysosomal enzyme targeting. It specifically catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate to the mannose residues on N-linked oligosaccharides of lysosomal enzymes. This modification is the initial step in the formation of M6P tags, which are recognized by M6P receptors in the Golgi apparatus. These receptors then direct the tagged enzymes to lysosomes. Without proper M6P tagging by GNPTAB, lysosomal enzymes are misdirected, leading to their secretion outside the cell instead of being transported to lysosomes.

### Location
GNPTAB is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it performs its function in enzyme tagging and sorting. The Golgi is the central hub for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins for delivery to their appropriate destinations within the cell. GNPTAB’s activity in the Golgi is critical for ensuring that lysosomal enzymes are properly tagged with M6P and delivered to lysosomes, where they are needed for cellular waste processing.

### Diseases
Mutations in the GNPTAB gene cause a group of lysosomal storage disorders known as mucolipidoses (ML), specifically ML II (I-cell disease) and ML III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy). These disorders result from the failure to properly tag lysosomal enzymes with M6P, leading to their mislocalization and a subsequent buildup of undigested substrates within lysosomes. Symptoms of these disorders include skeletal abnormalities, developmental delays, and organ dysfunction. The severity of the disease depends on the specific mutation in GNPTAB, with ML II being more severe than ML III. Understanding GNPTAB’s function is critical for diagnosing and developing treatments for these debilitating conditions.
