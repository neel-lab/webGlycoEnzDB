Write a 100-350 word essay about human MAN1C1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key scientific  references where I can find more information.

MAN1C1, known as Golgi alpha-mannosidase IC, is an important enzyme in the processing of N-linked glycans, a critical component in protein maturation and cellular function. It is one of the four alpha-mannosidase enzymes that are crucial in glycan processing in mammalian cells.

Functionally, MAN1C1 is responsible for cleaving alpha-mannose residues from N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins within the Golgi apparatus. This process is a key step in the maturation and quality control of glycoproteins. By trimming mannose residues from glycoproteins, MAN1C1 ensures that they attain proper folding and functionality. This enzymatic action is vital for a variety of cellular processes, including protein folding, quality control, signaling, and trafficking.

MAN1C1 participates in the pathway of N-linked glycan processing, a complex and essential process for the maturation of newly synthesized glycoproteins. In the Golgi apparatus, MAN1C1, along with other mannosidases, contributes to the sequential trimming of mannose residues, enabling glycoproteins to undergo subsequent processing steps necessary for their proper function.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, MAN1C1 plays a key role in the later stages of glycoprotein processing. Its position in the Golgi apparatus allows it to finely tune the glycan structures on glycoproteins, ensuring that they are correctly processed before being transported to their final cellular destinations.

While specific diseases directly associated with MAN1C1 mutations are not extensively documented, general dysfunction in glycan processing can lead to various conditions, including developmental disorders and immune system dysfunctions.

For more detailed information on MAN1C1, the following key scientific references are recommended:
