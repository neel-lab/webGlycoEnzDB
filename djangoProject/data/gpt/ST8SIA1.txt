Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST8SIA1 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ST8SIA1, also known as ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 1 or GD3 synthase, is an enzyme with a specialized role in the biosynthesis of gangliosides. ST8SIA1 is responsible for the transfer of sialic acid to existing sialylated glycolipids, particularly in the formation of b-series gangliosides such as GD3 from GM3.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST8SIA1 catalyzes the addition of a sialic acid residue to the sialic acid already present on the ganglioside GM3, producing GD3. This process is a critical step in the complex pathway of ganglioside biosynthesis. Gangliosides, such as GD3, are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids that are primarily found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and are especially abundant in the nervous system. They are involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction.

The expression and activity of ST8SIA1 are significant in the context of neural development and function. Abnormalities in ganglioside expression, potentially due to dysregulation of ST8SIA1, have been implicated in various neurological disorders. For instance, altered ganglioside patterns may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and developmental disorders.

Moreover, the enzyme has been studied in relation to cancer, as altered ganglioside patterns, including increased levels of GD3, have been observed in certain types of tumors. These changes can influence tumor growth, metastasis, and interactions with the immune system.

For more detailed information on ST8SIA1, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
