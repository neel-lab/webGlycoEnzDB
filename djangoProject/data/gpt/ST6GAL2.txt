Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST6GAL2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST6GAL2 (ST6 beta-galactosamide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the glycosylation process, specifically in the sialylation of glycoproteins. ST6GAL2 is involved in adding sialic acid to terminal galactose residues in oligosaccharides on glycoproteins, forming alpha-2,6 linkages. This modification is crucial for various biological functions, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein stability.

ST6GAL2 is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies glycoproteins by adding sialic acid to their N-glycans. The sialylated glycoconjugates are essential for numerous cellular processes. The specific action of ST6GAL2 in sialylation can significantly influence the physical properties of cell surfaces, alter ligand-receptor interactions, and affect the biological activity of glycoproteins.

The role of ST6GAL2 is less well-understood compared to ST6GAL1, another member of the same family. However, aberrations in ST6GAL2 expression or function may potentially contribute to various pathological conditions. For example, altered sialylation patterns have been implicated in cancer, where changes in glycan structures on the cell surface can impact tumor cell behavior, including metastasis, invasion, and immune evasion. Dysregulated expression or activity of ST6GAL2 might also play a role in autoimmune disorders by affecting immune cell recognition and activation.

While direct links between specific diseases and ST6GAL2 mutations are not extensively documented, the enzyme's role in critical glycosylation processes suggests potential involvement in various disorders, particularly those related to immune function and cancer.

For more detailed information on ST6GAL2, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
