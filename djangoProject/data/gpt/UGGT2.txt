Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGGT2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGGT2 (UDP-Glucose Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays an important role in the protein quality control system within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar to its homolog UGGT1, UGGT2 is involved in the process of glycoprotein folding, specifically in the reglucosylation of N-linked glycans on misfolded glycoproteins.

UGGT2 is localized in the ER, where it functions as part of the ER quality control system to ensure proper protein folding. The enzyme selectively adds glucose residues to N-linked glycans of misfolded glycoproteins. This reglucosylation acts as a signal for these misfolded proteins to re-enter the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, a system within the ER that assists in proper protein folding. If the protein fails to achieve its correct conformation, it is targeted for degradation through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can be harmful to the cell.

Disruptions in UGGT2 function can contribute to diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. While the specific disease associations of UGGT2 are less well-characterized compared to UGGT1, it is presumed to play a role in conditions where protein folding is critical, such as certain neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic diseases.

For more detailed information on UGGT2, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
