### Function
Human UGGT2, or UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2, is an enzyme that plays a vital role in the quality control system of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar to its homolog UGGT1, UGGT2 recognizes misfolded or incompletely folded glycoproteins and adds a glucose residue to their N-linked glycans. This glycosylation event serves as a signal for the glycoproteins to bind with ER chaperones, such as calnexin and calreticulin, which assist in the proper folding and maturation of these proteins.

### Reaction Pathways
UGGT2 functions within the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, a crucial pathway in the ER for ensuring proper glycoprotein folding. When UGGT2 adds a glucose residue to a misfolded glycoprotein, it promotes the interaction of the glycoprotein with calnexin and calreticulin, which facilitate its proper folding. If the glycoprotein fails to achieve the correct conformation, UGGT2 may re-glucosylate it, allowing repeated attempts at folding, or it may eventually target the protein for degradation through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.

### Location
UGGT2 is localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is ideally positioned to monitor and regulate the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. The ER is the primary site for protein synthesis and folding, making it the perfect environment for UGGT2 to perform its role in glycoprotein quality control.

### Diseases
Dysfunction or alterations in UGGT2 can contribute to diseases related to protein misfolding and aggregation. Similar to UGGT1, improper function of UGGT2 can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, potentially resulting in toxic aggregates that are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, disruptions in UGGT2 activity may influence immune system function by affecting the folding and processing of glycoproteins involved in immune signaling, potentially contributing to autoimmune diseases. Further research into UGGT2â€™s role could lead to better understanding and treatment of these protein misfolding disorders.
