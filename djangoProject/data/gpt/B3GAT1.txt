Write a 100-350 word essay about human B3GAT1: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human B3GAT1 (Beta-1,3-Glucuronyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans, particularly in the formation of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope. This epitope is found on a variety of cell adhesion molecules and is important for neural development and function.

B3GAT1 is involved in the transfer of glucuronic acid to specific substrates, forming the HNK-1 structure. This glycosylation process is essential for the proper functioning of several neural cell adhesion molecules, which are critical for cell-cell communication in the nervous system. The enzyme's activity contributes to various neural processes, including learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.

While there is no direct evidence linking B3GAT1 to human diseases, there have been suggestions of its association with psychiatric disorders. For instance, B3GAT1 was implicated in a family with severe psychiatric phenotypes, including schizophrenia, which had a balanced chromosomal translocation. Additionally, intronic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in B3GAT1 have been associated with schizophrenia and variations in cortical surface area.

For more detailed information on human B3GAT1, the following references are recommended:

Jeffries et al. (2003): Study suggesting the association of B3GAT1 with severe psychiatric phenotypes including schizophrenia.
Kahler et al. (2011): Research on intronic SNPs in B3GAT1 and their association with schizophrenia and cortical surface area.
These sources provide insights into the potential role of B3GAT1 in neural development and its possible links to psychiatric conditions​​.
