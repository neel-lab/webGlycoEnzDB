Write a 100-350 word essay about human ALG11: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ALG11 (Asparagine-Linked Glycosylation 11, Alpha-1,2-Mannosyltransferase) is an essential enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a vital cellular mechanism for protein folding and maturation. This pathway is crucial for the stability and functionality of a wide array of proteins, impacting various biological processes.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
ALG11 plays a key role in the addition of mannose residues to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor during the assembly of N-linked glycans. It specifically adds two alpha-1,2-mannose residues to the growing oligosaccharide chain. This step is essential in the synthesis of complex branched structures of N-linked glycans, which are subsequently transferred to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process is fundamental for ensuring proper protein folding, quality control, and maturation.

Location:
ALG11 is localized in the ER, the central site for the synthesis of N-linked glycans and the initial stages of protein folding. The ER's role as a hub for protein processing underscores the significance of ALG11â€™s enzymatic activity in cellular physiology.

Diseases:
Mutations in the ALG11 gene can lead to a form of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG11-CDG. CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the glycosylation process of proteins and lipids. Individuals with ALG11-CDG may exhibit a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, neurological issues, hypotonia, and other systemic manifestations. These symptoms highlight the essential role of N-linked glycosylation in various cellular functions and protein stability.

Key References:
For in-depth information on ALG11, the following key references are recommended:
