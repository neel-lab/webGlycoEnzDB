### Function
Human ALG11 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 11) is a crucial glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This enzyme specifically functions as an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, catalyzing the addition of mannose residues to the growing oligosaccharide precursor. ALG11 is responsible for adding the fourth and fifth mannose residues to the oligosaccharide, which are essential steps in forming the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) necessary for proper protein glycosylation.

### Reaction Pathways
The reaction pathway catalyzed by ALG11 involves the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to the growing oligosaccharide chain. ALG11 adds two alpha-1,2-linked mannoses sequentially to the Man3GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol intermediate. This process is a critical part of the LLO biosynthesis, which starts on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is completed in the lumen. The fully formed LLO is then transferred to nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, ensuring proper folding and function of glycoproteins.

### Location
ALG11 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it integrates into the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. The ER is the primary site for the early stages of N-glycosylation, where enzymes like ALG11 play a pivotal role in assembling the core glycan structures. By being situated in the ER, ALG11 can efficiently interact with its substrates, facilitating the stepwise construction of the oligosaccharide precursor necessary for glycoprotein synthesis.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG11 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ip (ALG11-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to the production of improperly folded glycoproteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG11-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, coagulation disorders, and liver dysfunction. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG11 is an essential enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating critical mannosylation steps necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER underscores its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG11 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in human health.
