### Function
Human ALG3 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 3) is an essential glycosyltransferase enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. It functions as an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase, responsible for adding the first mannose residue to the growing oligosaccharide precursor. This step is critical for forming the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) necessary for proper protein glycosylation, impacting protein folding and stability.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG3 catalyzes the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This addition of an alpha-1,3-linked mannose results in the formation of Man6GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This reaction is a crucial step in the assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor required for N-glycosylation. The process continues with further elongation and modification of the oligosaccharide chain before it is transferred to nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex within the ER lumen.

### Location
ALG3 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), embedded in the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. This strategic positioning allows ALG3 to efficiently access its substrates, GDP-mannose and the oligosaccharide precursor, facilitating the essential mannosylation steps in N-glycosylation. The ER is the primary site for the early stages of glycoprotein synthesis, where the initial assembly of the glycan structures takes place.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG3 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Id (ALG3-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly glycosylated proteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG3-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, and various organ dysfunctions. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG3 is a vital enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating key mannosylation steps necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER and its role in glycan assembly underscore its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG3 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting its critical role in human health.
