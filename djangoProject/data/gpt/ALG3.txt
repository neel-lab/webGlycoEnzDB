Write a 100-350 word essay about human ALG3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.





Human ALG3 is an essential enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, playing a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs), which are crucial for the attachment of carbohydrates to nascent proteins. ALG3, classified as a type C glycosyltransferase, utilizes lipid-linked sugar donors as substrates and is involved in the addition of mannose residues to these LLOs.

The ALG3 protein, located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), has multiple transmembrane domains, with its C-terminal domain containing the ER retrieval sequence. This localization is integral to its function in the N-glycosylation process that occurs within the ER. ALG3 is responsible for adding specific mannose residues to the growing oligosaccharide chain on dolichol phosphate, a key step in the assembly of LLOs​​.

Mutations in the ALG3 gene can lead to a type of congenital disorder of glycosylation known as ALG3-CDG (formerly CDG-Id). This disorder is characterized by a variety of symptoms ranging from slight mental or psychomotor impairment to severe multiple organ dysfunction and infantile lethality. The primary phenotype of ALG3 mutant cells is hypoglycosylation of N-glycoproteins, leading to the accumulation of suboptimal substrates for oligosaccharyltransferase. Despite Golgi glycosylation being able to occur normally on ALG3-derived N-glycans, the deficiencies in earlier glycosylation steps lead to significant biological consequences​​​​.

For more detailed information on human ALG3, the following references are recommended:

Korner et al. (1999): Discovery and characterization of a CDG syndrome caused by ALG3 deficiency.
Aebi et al. (1996): Cloning and characterization of the ALG3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its role in glycosylation.
Huffaker and Robbins (1982): Initial identification of yeast mutant strains deficient in ALG3 activity.
These references provide a comprehensive overview of ALG3's biochemical role, its significance in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, and its implications in human diseases, particularly in the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation​​.
