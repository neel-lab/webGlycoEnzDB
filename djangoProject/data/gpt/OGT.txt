Write a 100-350 word essay about human OGT: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human OGT (O-GlcNAc Transferase) is a pivotal enzyme in cellular metabolism, responsible for catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine) to serine or threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. This post-translational modification, known as O-GlcNAcylation, is crucial for regulating the function of a wide array of proteins involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, signal transduction, and stress response.

OGT is predominantly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it dynamically modifies proteins with O-GlcNAc. This modification is reversible and acts as a cellular nutrient sensor and stress regulator, counterbalancing phosphorylation and modulating protein function in response to cellular metabolic status. 

Dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation by OGT has been implicated in several diseases, most notably in neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, abnormal O-GlcNAcylation patterns are associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, contributing to the pathology. In diabetes, altered O-GlcNAcylation affects insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. In cancer, O-GlcNAcylation by OGT has been linked to tumor progression and the regulation of oncogenic pathways.

For more detailed information on OGT and its role in disease, the following key references are recommended:
