Write a 100-350 word essay about human ALG12: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ALG12 (Asparagine-linked glycosylation 12) is a key enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, essential for the proper folding and function of many proteins. ALG12 is a mannosyltransferase that plays a critical role in the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs), which are necessary for the attachment of carbohydrates to nascent proteins during N-linked glycosylation.

As part of the GT22 class of GT-C glycosyltransferases, ALG12 utilizes lipid-linked sugar donors as substrates. Specifically, ALG12 adds mannose to Dol-P-Man (dolichol-phosphate-mannose), a lipid carrier molecule in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). This step is crucial in the sequential assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor that is eventually transferred to nascent proteins in the ER, a process fundamental for their proper maturation and function.

Mutations in the ALG12 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to various clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and multisystemic manifestations. The specific type of CDG associated with ALG12 mutations is known as ALG12-CDG. The severity of the disease can vary depending on the nature of the mutation and its impact on the enzyme's function.

For more detailed information on human ALG12, the following references are recommended:

Korner et al. (1999): Study discussing congenital disorders of glycosylation, including those related to ALG12 mutations.
Haeuptle and Hennet (2009): Research on the implications of ALG12 in CDG.
Lairson et al. (2008): Classification and characteristics of GT-C glycosyltransferases, including ALG12.
These sources provide a comprehensive overview of ALG12's biochemical role, its significance in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, and its implications in human diseases, particularly in the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation​​.
