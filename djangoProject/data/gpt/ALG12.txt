### Function
Human ALG12 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 12 homolog) is a glycosyltransferase enzyme crucial for the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This enzyme specifically functions as an alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase, adding the eighth mannose residue to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor. The activity of ALG12 is essential for forming the mature glycan structures required for proper protein folding and function.

### Reaction Pathways
ALG12 catalyzes the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-mannose to the oligosaccharide intermediate Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. This reaction is a critical step in the elongation of the oligosaccharide chain in the N-glycosylation pathway. The fully formed oligosaccharide, once complete with its addition of mannose and glucose residues, is transferred to nascent polypeptides by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. This process ensures that glycoproteins acquire the necessary modifications for proper folding and stability.

### Location
ALG12 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it integrates into the ER membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytosol. The ER is the primary site for the initial steps of protein glycosylation, where enzymes like ALG12 participate in assembling the core glycan structures. By being situated in the ER, ALG12 can efficiently interact with its substrates, facilitating the stepwise construction of the oligosaccharide precursor necessary for glycoprotein synthesis.

### Diseases
Mutations in the ALG12 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ig (ALG12-CDG). These disorders result from defects in the glycosylation pathway, leading to improperly folded glycoproteins that affect multiple organ systems. Symptoms of ALG12-CDG include developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, coagulation abnormalities, and liver dysfunction. The severity and range of symptoms can vary widely, reflecting the critical role of proper glycosylation in cellular and systemic functions.

In summary, human ALG12 is an essential enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating a crucial mannosylation step necessary for proper protein glycosylation. Its localization in the ER underscores its importance in cellular function, and mutations in ALG12 can lead to significant congenital disorders, highlighting the enzyme's critical role in human health.
