Write a 100-350 word essay about human TMTC3: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human TMTC3 (Transmembrane and Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing 3) is part of the TMTC family, characterized by their transmembrane domains and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. TMTC3, like its family members, is speculated to be involved in various cellular functions, although its precise role is still being unraveled. 

Primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), TMTC3 is thought to play a role in protein folding and trafficking. The TPR motifs suggest its involvement in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial in numerous cellular processes, including the assembly of multiprotein complexes and regulation of enzymatic activities. 

The specific functions of TMTC3 in cellular pathways and its direct links to diseases are still subjects of ongoing research. However, given its localization and structural features, TMTC3 may be involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. Dysregulation of these pathways can lead to various pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders.

Recent studies have begun to explore the potential involvement of TMTC3 in developmental processes and neurological conditions. For example, aberrations in TMTC3 expression or function might be implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, given the ER's role in neuronal development and function.

For more detailed information on TMTC3, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
