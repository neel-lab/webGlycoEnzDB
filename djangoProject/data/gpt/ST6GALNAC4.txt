Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST6GALNAC4: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST6GALNAC4 (ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 4) is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the glycosylation pathway, particularly in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is responsible for transferring sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues on glycoconjugates, forming alpha-2,6-sialic acid linkages.

ST6GALNAC4 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it adds sialic acid to the GalNAc residues of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This sialylation is critical for the proper functioning of these molecules, as it influences their stability, activity, and interactions within the cell and with external factors. Sialylated glycoconjugates play vital roles in a range of biological processes including cell-cell communication, immune response, and signal transduction.

Although the specific physiological functions and disease associations of ST6GALNAC4 are less well-documented compared to other members of the ST6GALNAC family, aberrations in its expression or function may contribute to pathological conditions. For example, altered sialylation patterns, potentially influenced by changes in ST6GALNAC4 activity, have been implicated in various cancers. In tumor cells, modifications in glycosylation can impact cell behavior, affecting properties like adhesion, migration, and immune evasion.

Direct links between specific diseases and mutations in the ST6GALNAC4 gene are not extensively documented. However, its role in the critical glycosylation processes suggests potential involvement in various disorders, particularly those related to oncogenesis and immune function.

For more detailed information on ST6GALNAC4, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
