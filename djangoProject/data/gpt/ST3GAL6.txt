Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST3GAL6: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.


Human ST3GAL6 (ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 6) is an enzyme that plays a vital role in the process of glycosylation, specifically in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. ST3GAL6 is involved in the transfer of sialic acid to terminal galactose residues in oligosaccharides, forming alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid structures, a critical modification for various biological functions.

Located in the Golgi apparatus, ST3GAL6 is responsible for adding sialic acid to glycoconjugates, which are crucial for cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and immune responses. Sialylation, mediated by ST3GAL6, affects the stability, half-life, and biological activity of glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing their role in physiological and pathological processes.

The specific functions of ST3GAL6 are significant in immune regulation and inflammation. The enzyme contributes to the synthesis of sialylated structures involved in leukocyte trafficking and adhesion, a key process in the immune response. Additionally, ST3GAL6 is implicated in the modulation of signaling pathways associated with cell growth and differentiation.

While direct links between specific diseases and ST3GAL6 mutations are not extensively documented, alterations in sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL6 can potentially contribute to various pathological conditions. For instance, aberrant sialylation is implicated in cancer, where changes in cell surface glycosylation patterns can impact tumor cell behavior, including metastasis, invasion, and immune evasion. Dysregulated expression or activity of ST3GAL6 may also play a role in autoimmune disorders by affecting immune cell recognition and activation.

For more detailed information on ST3GAL6, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
