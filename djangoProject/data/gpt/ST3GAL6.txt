### Function
Human ST3GAL6, or ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 6, is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Specifically, ST3GAL6 adds sialic acid in an alpha-2,3 linkage to galactose residues on glycan chains, forming sialylated structures. These sialylated glycans are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, immune response, and cell signaling. ST3GAL6 plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of selectin ligands, which are important for leukocyte trafficking during immune responses.

### Reaction Pathways
ST3GAL6 operates in the sialylation pathway, where it transfers sialic acid from the donor molecule CMP-sialic acid to the terminal galactose of glycan chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is particularly involved in the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X (sLeX), a carbohydrate antigen that serves as a ligand for selectins. sLeX plays a crucial role in mediating the interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, facilitating the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation or injury.

### Location
ST3GAL6 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, the organelle responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. Within the Golgi, ST3GAL6 performs its function of sialylating glycan chains, ensuring that glycoproteins and glycolipids are properly modified before they are transported to the cell surface or secreted. This Golgi localization is essential for the enzyme's role in producing functional sialylated glycans, which are critical for cell communication and immune function.

### Diseases
Alterations in the expression or activity of ST3GAL6 have been associated with various diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, abnormal sialylation patterns mediated by ST3GAL6 can contribute to tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion by altering cell surface glycan structures. Additionally, changes in ST3GAL6 activity can impact immune responses, potentially leading to chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders. Understanding the role of ST3GAL6 in these processes is important for developing targeted therapies that address abnormal sialylation and its associated diseases.
