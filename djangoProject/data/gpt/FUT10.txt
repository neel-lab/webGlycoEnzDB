Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human FUT10. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function

Human FUT10 (fucosyltransferase 10) is an enzyme that belongs to the family of fucosyltransferases, specifically involved in the core fucosylation of glycoproteins. FUT10 transfers fucose residues from GDP-fucose to N-glycans, specifically attaching the fucose in an Î±1,3-linkage to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine of the glycan core. This type of core fucosylation is essential for the proper functioning of glycoproteins involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response  .

### Reaction Pathways

FUT10 operates within the glycosylation pathways, where it catalyzes the addition of a fucose residue to N-glycans. This reaction takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where FUT10 attaches fucose to glycoproteins as they are synthesized and folded. The fucosylation by FUT10 is a critical step in the maturation of glycoproteins, influencing their stability, recognition, and interaction with other cellular components .

### Location

FUT10 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is consistent with its role in the early stages of glycoprotein processing. Unlike most fucosyltransferases that are typically found in the Golgi apparatus, FUT10's ER localization allows it to modify glycoproteins soon after their synthesis. This unique positioning underscores its role in the initial glycosylation events that dictate the final structure and function of mature glycoproteins .

### Diseases

While the exact physiological and pathological roles of FUT10 are still under investigation, its involvement in core fucosylation suggests potential links to various diseases. Aberrant fucosylation patterns are commonly associated with cancer, where altered glycan structures can affect tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Additionally, FUT10's role in immune system function implies that its dysfunction could contribute to immune-related disorders. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the implications of FUT10 mutations or dysregulation in human diseases .

In summary, FUT10 is a key enzyme involved in core fucosylation, functioning within the endoplasmic reticulum to modify glycoproteins. Its activity is crucial for normal cellular processes, and disruptions in FUT10 function may have significant implications for disease development.
