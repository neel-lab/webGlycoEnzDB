### Function

Human EXT2 (exostosin-2) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan essential for various biological processes. EXT2 is a glycosyltransferase that works in tandem with EXT1 to form a heterooligomeric complex responsible for elongating HS chains. This enzyme alternately adds N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) to the growing HS polymer, a process vital for the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix.pdf】.

### Reaction Pathways

The EXT1/EXT2 complex operates by catalyzing the polymerization of HS chains through the addition of GlcNAc and GlcA units to a core protein linker sequence. This process begins with the formation of a tetrasaccharide linker, after which EXT1 and EXT2 alternately add GlcNAc and GlcA. Both EXT1 and EXT2 possess dual catalytic activities, functioning as GlcNAc transferase and GlcA transferase. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the correct assembly of HS chains, which are subsequently modified by sulfotransferases to acquire specific sulfation patterns that define their biological roles.pdf】.

### Location

EXT2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it forms a functional complex with EXT1. The Golgi localization is essential for its role in HS biosynthesis, allowing the enzyme to efficiently interact with glycoproteins and other components involved in the assembly of HS chains. This subcellular localization ensures that the synthesized HS chains are properly assembled and modified before being transported to the cell surface or extracellular matrix.pdf】.

### Diseases

Mutations in the EXT2 gene are associated with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of multiple benign bone tumors, known as osteochondromas. These tumors typically develop near the growth plates of long bones, leading to skeletal deformities, pain, and restricted movement. In some cases, these benign tumors can transform into malignant chondrosarcomas. HME is an autosomal dominant disorder, with mutations in EXT2 accounting for approximately 30-40% of cases. The critical role of EXT2 in HS biosynthesis underscores its importance in skeletal development and the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.pdf】.

In summary, human EXT2 is vital for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, functioning as part of a complex with EXT1 in the Golgi apparatus. Mutations in EXT2 can lead to hereditary multiple exostoses, highlighting the enzyme's crucial role in maintaining normal skeletal growth and development.
