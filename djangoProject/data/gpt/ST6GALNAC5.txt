### Function
Human ST6GALNAC5, or ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 5, is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues on glycoproteins, specifically forming sialyl-Tn antigen structures. This sialylation is particularly important in the brain, where ST6GALNAC5 contributes to the development and function of neural cells by modifying glycoproteins involved in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and membrane stability.

### Reaction Pathways
ST6GALNAC5 operates within the glycosylation pathway, particularly focusing on the sialylation of O-linked glycans on glycoproteins. It transfers sialic acid from the donor molecule CMP-sialic acid to GalNAc residues, resulting in the formation of sialylated structures like the sialyl-Tn antigen. These sialylated glycoproteins play crucial roles in neural cell adhesion, migration, and communication, influencing processes such as neural development and synaptic function.

### Location
ST6GALNAC5 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the central nervous system. It is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the post-translational modification of glycoproteins during their processing. The enzyme’s activity in the Golgi ensures that neural glycoproteins are properly sialylated, which is essential for their function in the nervous system.

### Diseases
Altered expression of ST6GALNAC5 has been linked to cancer, particularly in the context of breast cancer metastasis to the brain. The enzyme’s ability to promote the sialylation of glycoproteins involved in cell adhesion and migration may facilitate the spread of cancer cells to the brain, contributing to the progression of metastatic disease. Additionally, changes in sialylation patterns mediated by ST6GALNAC5 could potentially impact neurological disorders, although this area requires further research. Understanding the role of ST6GALNAC5 in these processes is critical for exploring therapeutic approaches to target its activity in cancer and possibly neurological conditions.
