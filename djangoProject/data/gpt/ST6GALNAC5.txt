Write a 100-350 word essay about human ST6GALNAC5: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human ST6GALNAC5 (ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 5) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the glycosylation process, specifically in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. ST6GALNAC5 is responsible for transferring sialic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues on glycoconjugates, forming unique alpha-2,6-sialic acid linkages.

Predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, ST6GALNAC5 catalyzes the addition of sialic acid to the GalNAc residues of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This sialylation is important for the proper function of these molecules, influencing their stability, activity, and interactions within the cell and the external environment. Sialylated glycoconjugates are integral to various biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune responses, and signal transduction.

ST6GALNAC5 has garnered attention for its potential role in cancer metastasis. Studies have shown that ST6GALNAC5 is involved in the formation of brain metastases, particularly in breast cancer. The enzyme's activity in sialylating glycoconjugates appears to facilitate the ability of cancer cells to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and establish secondary tumors in the brain. This finding underscores the significance of glycosylation patterns in cancer progression and metastasis.

While the direct links between ST6GALNAC5 dysfunction and specific diseases other than cancer are not extensively documented, the enzyme's role in glycosylation suggests potential involvement in various disorders, especially those related to oncogenesis.

For more detailed information on ST6GALNAC5, its function, and related diseases, particularly its role in cancer metastasis, the following key references are recommended:
