Write a 100-350 word essay about human XYLT2: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human XYLT2 (Xylosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme integral to the biosynthesis of proteoglycans, which are key components of the extracellular matrix in various tissues. Proteoglycans are vital for maintaining structural integrity, mediating cell signaling, and regulating cellular activities.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
XYLT2 shares a similar function with its isoenzyme, XYLT1, in catalyzing the initial step in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. This process involves the transfer of a xylose molecule from UDP-xylose to specific serine residues on the core protein of proteoglycans. This xylosylation is the first step in forming GAG chains such as chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, which are critical for the structure and function of proteoglycans. XYLT2's role is crucial in initiating the complex structure formation of proteoglycans.

Location:
XYLT2 is expressed in a variety of tissues, reflecting the ubiquitous need for proteoglycans across different organ systems. It is particularly important in tissues with high concentrations of extracellular matrix, such as cartilage, skin, and blood vessels.

Diseases:
Alterations or mutations in the XYLT2 gene can lead to disorders in proteoglycan synthesis, affecting tissue development and repair. Such dysfunctions have been associated with developmental and skeletal disorders. For instance, mutations in XYLT2 have been linked to spondyloocular syndrome, characterized by skeletal anomalies and eye problems, highlighting its importance in normal skeletal development.

Key References:
