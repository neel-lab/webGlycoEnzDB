Write a 100-350 word essay about human UGT2B17: it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human UGT2B17 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B17) is a significant enzyme in the body’s metabolic processes, particularly in phase II drug metabolism. As a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, UGT2B17 specializes in the glucuronidation of various substrates, including steroids, drugs, and other xenobiotics.

UGT2B17 is predominantly expressed in the liver, which is a key organ for detoxification and drug metabolism. However, its expression is also notable in other tissues such as the prostate, bone, and placenta. The enzyme’s primary function is to enhance the water solubility of lipophilic substances by conjugating them with glucuronic acid, thereby facilitating their excretion from the body.

One of the significant roles of UGT2B17 is in the metabolism of androgens and estrogens. This makes it crucial in the regulation of steroid hormones and potentially influential in the development and progression of hormone-related diseases, such as prostate and breast cancers. Genetic variations in UGT2B17, such as gene deletion polymorphisms, have been linked to differences in hormone metabolism and cancer risk.

UGT2B17 also plays an important role in the metabolism of certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. Variability in UGT2B17 activity can lead to differences in drug efficacy and toxicity, impacting therapeutic outcomes and patient safety. For instance, the enzyme’s involvement in the metabolism of certain opioids could influence pain management strategies.

For more detailed information on UGT2B17, its function, and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
