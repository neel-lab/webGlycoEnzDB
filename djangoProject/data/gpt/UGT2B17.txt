### Function
Human UGT2B17, or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B17, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism and detoxification of steroid hormones, drugs, and various xenobiotics through glucuronidation. UGT2B17 catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid to androgens, estrogens, and other lipophilic substances, making them more water-soluble and easier to excrete. This enzyme is particularly important in regulating the levels of active androgens like testosterone, contributing to hormone balance and overall metabolic homeostasis.

### Reaction Pathways
UGT2B17 functions within the glucuronidation pathway, a critical phase II metabolic process that facilitates the excretion of hydrophobic compounds. It transfers glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to hydroxyl groups on steroids, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This modification increases the solubility of these hormones, allowing them to be excreted through urine. UGT2B17 also plays a role in the metabolism of certain drugs and environmental toxins, contributing to their detoxification and elimination from the body.

### Location
UGT2B17 is primarily expressed in the liver, which is the central organ for detoxification and metabolism, and in the prostate, where it significantly contributes to androgen metabolism. The enzyme is also present in other tissues, including the kidneys and intestines, where it aids in the localized metabolism of hormones and xenobiotics. Its expression in these tissues enables UGT2B17 to effectively manage hormone levels and detoxify various substances throughout the body.

### Diseases
Genetic polymorphisms in the UGT2B17 gene can lead to variations in enzyme activity, significantly impacting the metabolism of androgens and influencing disease risk. For instance, the deletion of the UGT2B17 gene has been associated with altered testosterone metabolism, which can affect the diagnosis and management of conditions like prostate cancer. Additionally, variations in UGT2B17 activity may influence an individual’s response to drugs that are substrates for this enzyme, potentially leading to differences in drug efficacy and the risk of adverse reactions. Understanding UGT2B17’s role in these processes is crucial for developing personalized approaches to hormone-related diseases and optimizing drug therapies.
