Human CEMIP (Cell Migration Inducing Hyaluronan Binding Protein), also known as KIAA1199, is a protein with a complex role in cellular processes, particularly in cell migration, hyaluronan metabolism, and cancer biology. Its functions and pathways are of great interest in the context of tumorigenesis and tissue remodeling.

Function and Reaction Pathways:
CEMIP is involved in the degradation of hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). By regulating HA turnover, CEMIP influences various cellular functions such as cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. HA degradation mediated by CEMIP leads to the generation of HA fragments that can act as signaling molecules, affecting cell behavior and the microenvironment. Additionally, CEMIP is implicated in glycolysis and cellular metabolism, contributing to the altered metabolic states observed in cancer cells.

Location:
CEMIP is located in the cytoplasm and is also associated with the cell membrane. Its localization is significant for its roles in interacting with components of the ECM and in cellular signaling pathways.

Diseases:
CEMIP has been closely associated with cancer progression and metastasis. Its overexpression is observed in various types of cancers, including colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers. High levels of CEMIP correlate with increased invasiveness, poor prognosis, and metastasis in cancer patients. Its role in HA degradation and ECM remodeling is particularly relevant in tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, CEMIPâ€™s involvement in glycolysis links it to the metabolic adaptations seen in cancer cells.
