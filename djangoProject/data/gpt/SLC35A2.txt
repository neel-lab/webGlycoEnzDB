Write a 100-350 word essay about human SLC35A2 : it function, reaction pathways it participates in, where it is located and diseases related to it.  Provide 3-5 key references where I can find more information.

Human SLC35A2 is a UDP-galactose transporter, an essential component in the process of glycosylation, specifically in the transfer of galactose to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This transporter plays a crucial role in transporting UDP-galactose from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where it serves as a substrate for various galactosyltransferases.

Located in the Golgi membrane, SLC35A2 enables the incorporation of galactose into glycoconjugates during their synthesis and maturation. This step is vital for the proper functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids, as galactose residues are key components in determining the structure and function of these molecules. They play significant roles in cell-cell recognition, signaling, and immune responses.

Mutations in the SLC35A2 gene have been associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type IIm (CDG-IIm). This rare genetic condition is characterized by a range of symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and hypotonia. The disease arises from impaired glycosylation processes due to the deficient transport of UDP-galactose, leading to abnormal synthesis of glycoconjugates.

For more detailed information on SLC35A2 and its role in glycosylation and related diseases, the following key references are recommended:
