### Function
Human UGT2B28, or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B28, is an enzyme involved in the metabolism and detoxification of steroid hormones, particularly estrogens and androgens, through the process of glucuronidation. UGT2B28 catalyzes the attachment of glucuronic acid to these hormones, rendering them more water-soluble and facilitating their excretion from the body. This enzyme plays a vital role in regulating the levels of active steroid hormones, contributing to the maintenance of hormonal balance and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful substances.

### Reaction Pathways
UGT2B28 operates within the glucuronidation pathway, a key phase II metabolic process. It transfers glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to hydroxyl groups on steroid hormones, such as estradiol and testosterone. This reaction increases the solubility of these hormones, enabling their excretion via urine or bile. By glucuronidating these hormones, UGT2B28 helps modulate their bioavailability and activity within the body, playing a crucial role in hormone regulation and detoxification.

### Location
UGT2B28 is primarily expressed in hormone-sensitive tissues, including the liver, prostate, breast, and adipose tissue. The enzyme’s presence in these tissues allows it to effectively regulate local and systemic levels of steroid hormones. Its expression in the liver is particularly important for the systemic metabolism of circulating hormones, while its presence in the prostate and breast highlights its role in the localized regulation of androgens and estrogens, respectively.

### Diseases
Alterations in UGT2B28 expression or activity can impact hormone metabolism and contribute to disease risk. For example, variations in UGT2B28 activity have been associated with differences in estrogen and androgen metabolism, which may influence the development of hormone-related cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer. Additionally, dysregulation of UGT2B28 could affect the balance of active hormones, potentially contributing to conditions like hormone-dependent cancers and other disorders linked to hormonal imbalances. Understanding UGT2B28’s role in these processes is important for developing targeted therapies and improving the management of diseases related to steroid hormone metabolism.
