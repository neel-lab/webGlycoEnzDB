Write a 100-350 word essay about the enzyme human MANBA. Provide information related to enzyme: i) function, ii) reaction pathways, ii) Location, and iv) diseases. In writing include these four subheadings

### Function
Human MANBA, or beta-mannosidase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, specifically in the breakdown of mannose-containing oligosaccharides. MANBA hydrolyzes the terminal beta-linked mannose residues from the non-reducing ends of these oligosaccharides, facilitating their complete degradation. This process is vital for recycling the sugars from glycoproteins and glycolipids, ensuring proper cellular function and energy balance.

### Reaction Pathways
MANBA functions within the lysosomal degradation pathway, where it is involved in the final steps of glycoprotein and glycolipid catabolism. After the initial breakdown of larger glycan structures, MANBA acts by removing the beta-linked mannose residues from the oligosaccharides. This enzymatic activity is essential for the complete degradation of these molecules into monosaccharides, which can then be reused by the cell for various metabolic processes. The activity of MANBA is integral to maintaining the normal turnover of cellular components.

### Location
MANBA is localized in lysosomes, the organelles responsible for degrading and recycling various macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. The acidic environment of the lysosome is optimal for MANBA’s activity, allowing it to efficiently cleave mannose residues from complex oligosaccharides. This localization is critical for the enzyme’s role in the final stages of glycan degradation, ensuring that these molecules are fully processed and that cellular waste is properly managed.

### Diseases
Mutations in the MANBA gene lead to a rare lysosomal storage disorder known as beta-mannosidosis. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of partially degraded oligosaccharides within lysosomes due to the lack of functional MANBA enzyme. Symptoms of beta-mannosidosis can vary widely but often include intellectual disability, developmental delays, hearing loss, immune system deficiencies, and skeletal abnormalities. The severity of the disease depends on the specific mutation and its impact on enzyme activity. Understanding the function of MANBA is crucial for diagnosing and developing treatments for beta-mannosidosis and related lysosomal storage disorders.
